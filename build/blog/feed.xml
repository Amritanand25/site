    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id="toc_0"&gt;Does the West realize just how important programming is?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries like India, Russia, China, Vietnam, Romania certainly do! These countries are producing ever more, better quality developers every day. Small wonder as programming is extremely well paid, creative, fun and the developer stereotype is now &amp;#39;geek chic&amp;#39; rather than &amp;#39;spotty nerd&amp;#39;. So, what&amp;#39;s going wrong in the West?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the US, the global leader in tech, less than 2.4% of college students graduate with a degree in computer science - &lt;strong&gt;fewer than 10 years ago&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the UK&amp;#39;s Cambridge University, today&amp;#39;s Computer Science students interview with some web design skills but litle knowldge of coding, whereas 10 years ago students were often hobbyist programmers. This problem gave rise to the massively popular Raspberry Pi. (&lt;a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/about"&gt;This link&lt;/a&gt; makes for interesting reading).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.code.org"&gt;Code.org&lt;/a&gt; was launched in the US to try to address the severe developing problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a look at the infographic below for some sobering stats from Code.org (sorry about mangling the infographic, &lt;a href="http://www.code.org/stats"&gt;here is the original&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Code.org stats" src="/s/img/blog/codeinfographic2-21-1-af769729.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_1"&gt;The Problem with IT in Schools&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most school curricula focus on using Word, Excel and office prodcutivity tools - things that kids these days pick up in 5 minutes without any instruction. Governments are now trying to put in place curricula that incorporate coding. It&amp;#39;s quite easy to imagine how a committee designed curriculum might look. Not compatible with the dynamic world of IT and espcially not when it comes to learning to code. By the time a curriculum has been worked through and published, large chunks will be out of date and it will be static for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_2"&gt;The Solution : CrowdTeaching &amp;amp; Collaboration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case educators don&amp;#39;t think it can be done, I suggest they take a look at the Open Source community. It is populated by very smart, community oriented people who know how to code and many of whom are all too happy to try to explain how things work. Github alone has nearly 5 million developers on its books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes, many open source projects may be woeful, but the great stuff floats very efficiently to the top and nowadays Open Source software is at or near the centre of every single great IT company without exception. Ask Google, Twitter, Facebook, IBM, Accenture - Open Source works and is used extensively. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when it comes to educational content, there will be woeful content, too, but there will be some extraordinarily good content, too. Apply the open source approach and ideals to tutorials and teaching people to code, whether beginner, intermediate or advanced, and you have a recipe for success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone can take any tutorial made by anyone and then &amp;#39;fork&amp;#39; (copy) it and make improvements. These improvements can be small, in which case they are requested to be re-absorbed by the original creator, or they can be the starting point for an entirely new direction. There are now absolute &amp;#39;Owners&amp;#39; as every project is permissively Open Sourced and can be found and updated by anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_3"&gt;What Codio is going to do to make this happen&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Codio it about to announce several features that will enable this to happen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a teaching platform and feature set based on the Codio IDE (all completely free) called &lt;a href="https://codio.com/s/blog/2013/04/say-it-with-a-sample/"&gt;Codio:Annotations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a Github based content framework for content creation and collaboration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a standard educational license that all content should use, allowing completely unrestricted copying and modifications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an active curation program backed by a Codio staff that will provide guidance and organization for any programming language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a curation feature set within Codio that allows people to categorize, tag and vote, helping learners find the best material quickly and easily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these features, there will be a vehicle for a truly post-curriculum approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_4"&gt;Developers don&amp;#39;t have to use Codio&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though Codio will have a unique and rich set of code annotation and documentation features, we don&amp;#39;t want to force people to use Codio. The Codio:Annotation features can be accessed from a developer&amp;#39;s favorite IDE, but there is no requirement to use Codio to submit content to the Github library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_5"&gt;What about Teachers and Teaching&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We aim for these initiatives to be a rich resource for teachers to draw on. As every bit of content it open and collaborative, we expect forward looking teachers to be active particpants and take inspiration from others and pass this on. They can structure their own courses around existing materials, always looking to update and use the best content available. We think this will attract the new generation of teachers as well as the new generation of coders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_6"&gt;Turning student on to coding - celebrity coders&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will organize global Webinars and interviews with luminaries from the world of coding. These webinars will on the one hand stimulate pupils and students to hear straight from important software developers why it is such a great profession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_7"&gt;Teach to 30&amp;#39;000 not 30&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaboration is also a fantastic way of bringing the best out of teachers. Imagine a teacher who is doing a stupendous job of motivating their students. Isn’t it a real waste for them to have their brilliance shine only on their own class of students? Their content is available to the whole world. And why not let them arrange a course or webinar that is broadcast to anyone who wants to watch it. These webinars are, of course, recorded and can be viewed by anyone. And less collaboratively inclined teachers can still piggy back on those materials and use them with their students in whatever way works best for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_8"&gt;So, let&amp;#39;s act&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that this mini manifesto is the foundation for a revolutionary approach to the way Coding is taught and gives access to a truly exciting and lucrative career to huge numbers of students. It is a great thing that developing countries can expand their economies thanks to IT and I don&amp;#39;t know of anyone who begrudges them this one bit. However, it is shameful that complacent western countries stand idly by and watch as IT skills drain away.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Having watched the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/nKIu9yen5nc"&gt;code.org video&lt;/a&gt; and seen what they are trying to achieve, we wondered how cool it would be if we could contribute to this initiative in a meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, we can. We have a great Web IDE and with a little effort, we&amp;#39;ve got a game changer for the way tutorials, documentation and code samples are delivered. We want this to be a free, web based platform that let&amp;#39;s any author of code examples or tutorials deliver their content in a natural way, that doesn&amp;#39;t dumb anything down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get you interested, take a look below. It&amp;#39;s a real and fully functioning IDE. It&amp;#39;s fast, doesn&amp;#39;t require signup, can be embedded anywhere and is being aggressively developed. However, as a vehicle for providing working code tutorials and examples, it&amp;#39;s a great start. Once we&amp;#39;ve added our annotation features, we think it&amp;#39;ll be awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, &lt;a href="https://codio.com/fmay/Impress/tree/Impress/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; to see the IDE full size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="950" height="600" src="https://codio.com/fmay/Impress/tree/Impress/index.html" style="margin:20px 0;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next couple of months (with some &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/home/?status=Codio%20web%20platform%20turns%20your%20%23code%20into%20interactive%20tutorials%20%26%20code%20samples.%20%20https%3A%2F%2Fcodio.com%2Fs%2Fblog%2F2013%2F03%2Fcodio-for-education%2F%20-%20gr8%20for%20%23Education%20%26%20%23developers%20" target="_blank"&gt;verbal encouragement&lt;/a&gt; from the community) we&amp;#39;ll be adding a lot of very cool stuff to Codio, so people can teach and learn in code&amp;#39;s natural home - the IDE. You&amp;#39;ll be able to add guided tours, rich text explanations that pop-up as you explore the project, audio, and even videos that [for example] show screen output when a piece of code executes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll be able to set this all up from your own IDE as well as within Codio, and it will not interfere with or mess up your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_0"&gt;What&amp;#39;s the problem with online tutorials?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I say &lt;strong&gt;tutorial&lt;/strong&gt;, I don&amp;#39;t mean novice developer tutorials, but also advanced APIs, frameworks, libraries or products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three main issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The natural environment for a code project or example is an IDE, but tutorials are forced to show code snippets - often lots of them. A bit like &lt;a href="http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/tutorials/creating_and_modifying_html" target="_blank"&gt;this top quality tutorial&lt;/a&gt; from webplatform.org. This can mean a lot of mental gymnastics as you read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;#39;m learning, there isn&amp;#39;t usually any &lt;strong&gt;instant&lt;/strong&gt; access to a full, working project, and if there is, it has to be downloaded and installed somewhere. Again, what we would love is instant access to an online or even embedded IDE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I usually find myself wanting to run the project, then make my own modifications and run it again. Experiment in other words. You rarely have this facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these problems were solved, with interactivity at the heart of it, it would significantly speed up the way new coding material is absorbed and taught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_1"&gt;Codio:Annotations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re calling all this. We&amp;#39;re going to make the whole teaching/learning process highly interactive and fun for the learners and the authors. Learners will get either guided tours around the project, or be able to explore the code freely, and get information wherever they are looking. We&amp;#39;ll have more details very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few key points about the platform:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s a web platform, so instantly accessible for learners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authors and learners can access without needing to signup (no nasty dialogs or screens before you see the code).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no commercial catch - any public tutorial or example is, and always will be, free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s great for absolutely any programming language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has to work beautifully for school pupils, but equally great for highly advanced stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will be a great way of adding code samples into any form of API or developer documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_2"&gt;Give us some encouragement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like what you are reading, we ask that you encourage us in any way that you feel will help. The best way is to let others know. We&amp;#39;re a small company and doing this requires a fair bit of effort. So feel free to &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/home/?status=Codio%20web%20platform%20turns%20your%20%23code%20into%20interactive%20tutorials%20%26%20code%20samples.%20%20https%3A%2F%2Fcodio.com%2Fs%2Fblog%2F2013%2F03%2Fcodio-for-education%2F%20-%20gr8%20for%20%23Education%20%26%20%23developers%20" target=" target="_blank"&gt;tweet something nice!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://gruntjs.com/"&gt;Grunt&lt;/a&gt; is an extremely useful tool that any self-respecting front-end developer should have in his/her arsenal. At Codio, we use it to concatenate, minify, lint, compile and build our client side code ready for deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of last Friday&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="/s/blog/2013/03/our-twenty-percent-time/"&gt;weekly hack day&lt;/a&gt;, I spent the day upgrading our Grunt installation and our custom tasks to the latest 0.4 version. So I thought I&amp;#39;d write a short article on what Grunt is and how we use it at Codio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_0"&gt;What is Grunt?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a Javascript task runner, which simply means you can use it to automate your most mundane and common development and build tasks. The less work you have to do when performing repetitive tasks like minification, compilation, unit testing, linting, etc, the easier your job becomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since version 0.4, Grunt has really matured and come out of its shell, and now boasts a large ecosystem of plugins that can help you automate pretty much anything you want. And if you don&amp;#39;t find a plugin that does what you want, it&amp;#39;s extremely easy to write one yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_1"&gt;How to install Grunt?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grunt runs on &lt;a href="http://nodejs.org/"&gt;NodeJS&lt;/a&gt;, and is installed and managed via &lt;a href="https://npmjs.org/"&gt;NPM&lt;/a&gt;. So if you haven&amp;#39;t already, make sure you have both those installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To install Grunt, just use NPM:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install -g grunt-cli
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will give you a handy little &lt;code&gt;grunt&lt;/code&gt; command, which you will use to run your Grunt tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_2"&gt;Preparing your Project for Grunt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical setup will require two files:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;package.json&lt;/strong&gt; - This file is used by NPM to manage your projects dependencies, and is also used by Grunt to manage its dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gruntfile.js&lt;/strong&gt; - This is where you define and configure your tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a new file in the root of your project called &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;my-project-name&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;version&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;0.1.0&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;devDependencies&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;grunt&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;~0.4.1&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;grunt-contrib-uglify&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;~0.2.0&amp;quot;
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tells NPM that we depend on the &lt;code&gt;grunt&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;grunt-contrib-uglify&lt;/code&gt; packages. Running the following will install these dependencies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now create your &lt;code&gt;Gruntfile.js&lt;/code&gt;, which also belongs in the root of your project alongside &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;. Fill the file with the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;module.exports = function(grunt) {

  // Project configuration.
  grunt.initConfig({
    uglify: {
      build: {
        src: &amp;#39;src/script.js&amp;#39;,
        dest: &amp;#39;build/script.min.js&amp;#39;
      }
    }
  });

  // Load the plugin that provides the &amp;quot;uglify&amp;quot; task.
  grunt.loadNpmTasks(&amp;#39;grunt-contrib-uglify&amp;#39;);

  // Default task(s).
  grunt.registerTask(&amp;#39;default&amp;#39;, [&amp;#39;uglify&amp;#39;]);

};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets run through this file from top to bottom...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Line 4&lt;/strong&gt; is where we set define our configuration for the tasks we want to use. Each top level element defines a task. In our example, we have just one task &lt;code&gt;uglify&lt;/code&gt;, which simply takes the value of &lt;code&gt;build.src&lt;/code&gt;, runs it through the Uglify lib and places its output in a new file as specified with the value of &lt;code&gt;buil.dest&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;grunt.initConfig({
  uglify: {
    build: {
      src: &amp;#39;src/script.js&amp;#39;,
      dest: &amp;#39;build/script.min.js&amp;#39;
    }
  }
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Line 14&lt;/strong&gt; tells Grunt to load the &lt;code&gt;grunt-contrib-uglify&lt;/code&gt; task from the NPM package specified in our &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then finally on &lt;strong&gt;line 17&lt;/strong&gt;, we create a new &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; task, which is simply an alias for the &lt;code&gt;uglify&lt;/code&gt; task. The &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; task will be run if you don&amp;#39;t specify any task on the command line. So the following three commands are now identical:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;grunt uglify
grunt default
grunt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_3"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grunt has a great ecosystem of open source plugins, and a place to &lt;a href="http://gruntjs.com/plugins"&gt;find and search for the plugin you want&lt;/a&gt;. I strongly recommend that you take a look through them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully from this simple example, you can see how easy and powerful Grunt can be. It&amp;#39;s also worth noting that we have plans to implement a similar task based system directly into Codio. So watch this space!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, for the very first time, the Codio engineering team will be trying something new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google is famous for allowing and indeed encouraging its engineers to use 20% of their time to work on anything that they want. This 20% allowance has resulted in Gmail and other popular Google products. So we wanted to try something similar by encouraging our engineers to work on anything that they want. The only proviso is that it must be something related to Codio itself, or something that will benefit the team with their work on Codio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So tomorrow and then every Friday after, we will be working on whatever the hell we want!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s exciting and I&amp;#39;m hoping to be able to take part myself as I don&amp;#39;t get to do much coding these days. If just one new feature or small bug fix comes out of these, I think it will still be deemed a success. This is not only a way to discover and build new features for Codio, but also as a bonding exercise within the team, and a way to have a little fun with something different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also a great excuse to be free from the daily constraints of picking and working on tickets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be sure to let you all know how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As you should already know by now, we &lt;a href="/s/blog/2013/03/codio-is-live-and-kicking/"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; Codio into public beta yesterday. It's an all new cloud based IDE, and it will be the very first cloud based IDE that every developer will love to use, day in and day out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As you should already know by now, we &lt;a href="/s/blog/2013/03/codio-is-live-and-kicking/"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; Codio into public beta yesterday. It&amp;#39;s an all new cloud based IDE, and it will be the very first cloud based IDE that every developer will love to use, day in and day out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We live not in a passive society, a read-only society, but in a writable society.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaboration is the very first thing we thought about when we first sat down to plan Codio, and has continued to be at the very heart of almost everything we are building since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaboration is arguably the single biggest advantage when using software in the browser, because the browser is constantly connected via the internet, and because the browser is now the most used application on almost any device. Collaboration is also hugely important when writing software and especially when building for the web. It empowers us to do more, while remaining in the [virtual] company of our friends and colleague&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of collaborating between you and others when using the browser and the internet are zero. Email, Twitter, Skype - these are all free to use, and they are all about collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It is the long history of humankind (and animal kind, too) those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed.&amp;quot; - Charles Darwin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, but now I hear a few of you asking the question &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;what if I don&amp;#39;t have anyone to collaborate with?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;. The answer to that is easy and simple... &lt;strong&gt;you do!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is full of like-minded people just like you. People who love building web apps, designing web sites, or creating mobile applications. And they all have something to share, even you! And whether you realise it or not, you co-ordinate and collaborate every single day, with people you have never met or spoken to before. No matter what accomplishments you make, odds are somebody helped you along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest sites are essentially all about encouraging collaboration and making it easier for us to co-ordinate with each other. Sites and apps like Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, Wikipedia, Github, Basecamp, and now Codio are leading the way here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaboration is &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; powerful, and we think you&amp;#39;ll love what you can already do with Codio. If you &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/codiohq"&gt;follow us on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; we&amp;#39;ll let you know every time we increase our levels of collaboration within Codio, because we have loads more planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next few posts, I will be detailing just how Codio can help improve collaboration for you and your team.&lt;/p&gt;
