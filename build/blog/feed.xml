But we need some additional help from an experienced front-end engineer who want to be part of something truly exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one...&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Now we have the &lt;a href="/s/blog/2013/03/codio-is-live-and-kicking/"&gt;beta out the door&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#39;s time to concentrate on the future of Codio and working towards that perfect IDE. But we need some additional help from an experienced front-end engineer who want to be part of something truly exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one of our front-end engineers, you&amp;#39;ll be responsible for building arguably the most important part of Codio. The IDE itself is a single page app built using the latest Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3 technologies. We hate IE and love any browser which sits on the cutting edge of the web, so you will be encouraged to play with and implement the latest and greatest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are also our target market for the product itself, which makes it an extremely attractive and exciting product to work on. You&amp;#39;ve most likely heard this said before, but we really do have something that is built for developers, and by developers. We want you to be happy to use Codio as your day to day IDE, and if you aren&amp;#39;t, help us to get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want someone who is free thinking, passionate and has a love of what they do. If you find yourself still hacking away at 4am without realising the time, then you&amp;#39;re the kind of person we want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="toc_0"&gt;What we want from you:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3+ years professional experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience and knowledge of Javascript (including jQuery), HTML5 and CSS3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognition of the benefits of test driven development and well tested code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of the browser market and its changing pace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An eye for detail, both in your code and in the browser. Developers can be a picky bunch you know ;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common sense when it comes to UI and UX.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work well in a team and on your own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A love of open source software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="toc_1"&gt;You&amp;#39;ll be at an advantage if you also:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have an eye for good design, and experience with Photoshop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enjoy writing, blogging and speaking at tech conferences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have experience with Java.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribute or have created any open source software (big brownie points for this one).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re a distributed team with our HQ in the UK, so you will be able to work from anywhere you please. We would prefer if you were UK or European based, but if you&amp;#39;re really good, we don&amp;#39;t care where you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="toc_2"&gt;To Apply&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drop us an email at &lt;a href="mailto:work@codio.com"&gt;work@codio.com&lt;/a&gt; telling us why we should hire you, along with your resume/CV if you have one. Although we&amp;#39;d be much more interested in your Github profile, which speaks volumes about you and what you are capable of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, please let me know in the blog comments.&lt;/p&gt;

It's an all new cloud based IDE, and it will be the very first cloud based IDE that every developer will love to use, day in and day out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As you should already know by now, we &lt;a href="/s/blog/2013/03/codio-is-live-and-kicking/"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; Codio into public beta yesterday. It&amp;#39;s an all new cloud based IDE, and it will be the very first cloud based IDE that every developer will love to use, day in and day out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We live not in a passive society, a read-only society, but in a writable society.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaboration is the very first thing we thought about when we first sat down to plan Codio, and has continued to be at the very heart of almost everything we are building since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaboration is arguably the single biggest advantage when using software in the browser, because the browser is constantly connected via the internet, and because the browser is now the most used application on almost any device. Collaboration is also hugely important when writing software and especially when building for the web. It empowers us to do more, while remaining in the [virtual] company of our friends and colleague&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of collaborating between you and others when using the browser and the internet are zero. Email, Twitter, Skype - these are all free to use, and they are all about collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It is the long history of humankind (and animal kind, too) those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed.&amp;quot; - Charles Darwin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, but now I hear a few of you asking the question &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;what if I don&amp;#39;t have anyone to collaborate with?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;. The answer to that is easy and simple... &lt;strong&gt;you do!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is full of like-minded people just like you. People who love building web apps, designing web sites, or creating mobile applications. And they all have something to share, even you! And whether you realise it or not, you co-ordinate and collaborate every single day, with people you have never met or spoken to before. No matter what accomplishments you make, odds are somebody helped you along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest sites are essentially all about encouraging collaboration and making it easier for us to co-ordinate with each other. Sites and apps like Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, Wikipedia, Github, Basecamp, and now Codio are leading the way here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaboration is &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; powerful, and we think you&amp;#39;ll love what you can already do with Codio. If you &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/codiohq"&gt;follow us on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; we&amp;#39;ll let you know every time we increase our levels of collaboration within Codio, because we have loads more planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next few posts, I will be detailing just how Codio can help improve collaboration for you and your team.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are extremely excited to announce the immediate availability of Codio in public beta. This means you can play with what will become the world&amp;#39;s very first IDE that addresses all aspects of the HTML5 development life-cycle right now! We&amp;#39;re building an IDE that any developer will want and enjoy using every single day, because there is currently no such thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;#39;t take my word for it. &lt;strong&gt;Just click the &amp;quot;Create &amp;amp; Play!&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; link at the top of the page to create your first Codio project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Codio IDE" src="/s/img/blog/ide-68ac0fff.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been a hard and arduous road, but we&amp;#39;re finally at the start of it. Yes I did say the start, and that&amp;#39;s because we have so much more to come. Building the perfect IDE is no small task you know, but what we&amp;#39;re releasing today is the foundation that will set up that which is to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the press release and subscribe to this blog to stay informed...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Codio today announced its launch in public beta, giving developers of all skill levels access to a powerful, web-based visual IDE for HTML5+CSS+JS development. More than a typical code editor, Codio covers the complete web development cycle, from prototype to deployment. It offers novice developers a barrier free way to learn how to build web applications, but is also targeted very much at professional web developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There is a lot of stuff to install, setup and configure before you can write a single line of code. We feel that  there is no good reason for this and even developers, who deal with complexity on a daily basis, don’t like to waste  time. Modern web applications have raised expectations significantly with respect to usability and a web based approach to web development opens up lots of exciting new possibilities. Ultimately, coding should be fun and a happy developer produces happy code!” says CEO Freddy May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evolution of the web has witnessed paradigm shifts in new web technologies. The demand and popularity of web app development has, consequently, secured HTML5, CSS and JavaScript its place among the most popular development  languages. As a large number of modern applications now run in browsers, these technologies have become an integral part of most software development projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“By concentrating specifically on HTML5, CSS and JavaScript we can focus on the largest part of the developer ecosystem. This allows us constantly to add significant value that would otherwise not be possible if we were to try to cater for all languages,” says May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the era of the cloud it is logical that web applications should not just run on the web, but also be built on the web. Codio offers developers an efficient, modern, and secure IDE whose code is accessible anywhere online via Codio workspaces and shareable with others in a similar way to Github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Codio makes getting started very simple by allowing developers to use it without even signing up. It offers a comfortable environment not just for code editing but also deployment, collaboration, Git and Mercurial integration, as well as support for derivative languages such as Coffeescript, SCSS, LESS all without the need to install, configure and maintain hardware and software stacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Codio also brings enhanced collaboration to developers. Traditionally, developers collaborate using web based code repositories such as Github and Bitbucket. Codio supports Source Control Management but also adds real time code editing by multiple developers rather like Google Docs. Text chat, voice chat and video are also planned for later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Codio is being aggressively developed and many new features will be appearing on a continuous deployment basis. Some notable features on the horizon are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multi-pane code editing&lt;br&gt;
Development, staging, production deployment targets&lt;br&gt;
WYSIWYG GUI editor&lt;br&gt;
Interactive code documentation for teaching&lt;br&gt;
Instant preview&lt;br&gt;
Version control&lt;br&gt;
Node.js support&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Codio is expected to come out of Public Beta in middle of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
