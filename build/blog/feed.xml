    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You have always been able to preview your code from right within the Codio IDE, but this ability to preview was never intended to be a hosting solution for your production apps. We have always wanted to make it as easy as possible for you to deploy your apps. So I am very excited to announce our latest new feature that is available right now to all users. Announcing Codio:Deployment - a single click and your app is deployed to your production environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/s/img/blog/deployment-07f08697.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Codio:Deployment is available to users with admin permissions on any project. You can create one or more deployment targets, which can be used to setup different environments - perhaps for production and staging. Then any time you are ready to deploy your code, just choose the target you want, and click deploy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now we support deploying your projects over FTP, but we do have immediate plans to allow you to deploy to Parse and NodeJitsu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the easiest and fastest way to get started is to host your code right here with us. Powered by Amazons S3 cloud storage, you can host your client-side apps and static content with us. Just choose the &amp;quot;Codio&amp;quot; deployment destination, and hit deploy. No server to setup, and no complex configuration needed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Documentation can be found in the &lt;a href="/s/docs/deployment/"&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;, but it&amp;#39;s so easy to use, that we recommend you simply dive in and give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are really happy to announce the release of Codio:Annotations, and we don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;ll have seen anything quite like this before. It is an amazing way of documenting code where you need to explain things through code examples. Tutorials, APIs, frameworks and libraries are the usual suspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_0"&gt;The problem with tutorials&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tutorials, no matter how well they are written require mental leaps as you read large amounts of text, liberally seasoned with code snippets. Here is &lt;a href="http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/tutorials/events_in_javascript"&gt;a link to a very high quality tutorial&lt;/a&gt; from webplatform.org. Take a look at it and imagine you have to learn from it. Wouldn&amp;#39;t it be great if I had a complete, working project, ready to run and all shown and documented within a proper IDE. Read on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_1"&gt;What it does&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the same material in the Codio IDE with annotations added to it. You can play with the IDE below or &lt;a href="https://codio.com/codio/Oscillating-Spring"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; to see it full screen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three things you should play around with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The blue icons are clickable in the file tree and within a source file; try a few out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press the &amp;#39;Tour&amp;#39; button at the top and you will be given a guided tour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press &amp;#39;Preview&amp;#39; and the App will run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;iframe src="https://codio.com/codio/Oscillating-Spring" width="940px" height="600" frameborder="0" marginheight="20" marginwidth="35" scrolling="auto"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_2"&gt;Learn more&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about Codio:Annotations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/#examples"&gt;See some more examples&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/s/docs/annotations/"&gt;Read the Codio:Annotations documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://youtube.com/v/Fk3eG_eSRPM"&gt;Watch a Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_3"&gt;More to come&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the very first version and we have a lot more features planned. We are especially keen to get your feedback so please make sure you let us have your comments (comments below or using the envelope icon within the IDE).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_4"&gt;Support our campaign&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Codio:Annotations is completely free and we are trying to raise awareness of a campaign we are running to get coding taught in schools. Evil flourishes where good men do nothing (ok, a little melodramatic), so if you think that the state of teaching coding in schools is as terrible as we do, then simply &lt;a href="/s/education"&gt;add your name&lt;/a&gt; to the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are always extremely mindful of ensuring that your Codio experience is as secure and safe as possible. So with this in mind, we just rolled out a change in the way that you preview private projects. Previously, we used a cookie to authenticate such requests. This was done to ensure that only those with read permissions could actually preview. However, this method is prone to abuse and could allow an attacker to preview your private projects, regardless of whether they had permission to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mornings release completely removes this dependence on cookies to authenticate when previewing. Instead, you will be prompted to enter your Codio login if and when you preview a private project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note, that you will not be prompted to authenticate when previewing public projects - for obvious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As you may have read in previous posts, we&amp;#39;re trying to change the approach to IT education and we believe that coding needs to be centre stage - well at least on stage - in schools. One of the great things about coding is that it can be fun and can draw on other strengths and talents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example projects you see below draw on creativity, math, physics and even a smattering of art. We are trying to get people to realize that &lt;strong&gt;CODING IS FUN&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone has cool examples of code that draws on talent and creativity from other areas, please add your suggestions in the comments below this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_0"&gt;Explore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are three simple projects displayed in the Codio IDE (which is live and clickable, so go ahead). Each of these can be run in the browser (press Preview button) and you can explore the code in the IDE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_1"&gt;Tearable Cloth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMPORTANT:&lt;/strong&gt; this is a live IDE, not an image, so explore the code and press Preview to run the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src="https://codio.com/codio/Tear-able-Cloth-Demo" width="900" height="500" frameborder="0" marginheight="20" marginwidth="35" scrolling="auto"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_2"&gt;Multi-Touch Boids&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;iframe src="http://embed.ted.com/talks/sugata_mitra_build_a_school_in_the_cloud.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are four of my favorite parts if you don&amp;#39;t have time to watch the whole video&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_0"&gt;The hole-in-the-wall computer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sugata tells the story of how he put a &amp;#39;hole-in-the-wall&amp;#39; computer, connected to the web, in a small village in India where the kids had never seen a computer and couldn&amp;#39;t speak any English. He then went away for 3 months and left them to it. When he came back, the kids had not only collectively figured out how to use the computer, surf the web etc. but they had taught themselves English so they could figure out how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_1"&gt;Teaching DNA replication to 12 year olds&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He deposited a hole-in-the-wall computer in another village and then asked kids to find out all they could about DNA Replication, certain that they would fail at this complex task. They didn&amp;#39;t become biochemists but they achieved a 50% score in a test for people 8 years older at a private school in New Delhi with a proper biochemistry teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_2"&gt;The English Accent experiment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An experiment to teach Indian kids to speak English without their usual very strong accents (and therefore improve their job prospects). The solution involved not a second of teaching. He gave them a speech-to-text recognition engine and left them to it. If there accents were not good enough, the computer could not recognize their speech and nothing would come up on screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_3"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that there are some important lessons to be learnt from these stories. Kids will learn if they are given some very basic opportunities. If teachers are not available, well never mind. If you add great, modern teachers into the mix, who are capable of teaching not just their class of 30, but a class of 300,000 - now that&amp;#39;s teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Post-Curriculum approach to teaching programming</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id="toc_0"&gt;Does the West realize just how important programming is?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries like India, Russia, China, Vietnam, Romania certainly do! These countries are producing ever more, better quality developers every day. Small wonder as programming is extremely well paid, creative, fun and the developer stereotype is now &amp;#39;geek chic&amp;#39; rather than &amp;#39;spotty nerd&amp;#39;. So, what&amp;#39;s going wrong in the West?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the US, the global leader in tech, less than 2.4% of college students graduate with a degree in computer science - &lt;strong&gt;fewer than 10 years ago&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the UK&amp;#39;s Cambridge University, today&amp;#39;s Computer Science students interview with some web design skills but little knowldge of coding, whereas 10 years ago students were often hobbyist programmers. This problem gave rise to the massively popular Raspberry Pi. (&lt;a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/about"&gt;This link&lt;/a&gt; makes for interesting reading).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.code.org"&gt;Code.org&lt;/a&gt; was launched in the US to try to address the severe developing problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a look at the infographic below for some sobering stats from Code.org (sorry about mangling the infographic, &lt;a href="http://www.code.org/stats"&gt;here is the original&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Code.org stats" src="/s/img/blog/codeinfographic2-21-1-e9dc9307.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_1"&gt;The Problem in Schools&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most school curricula focus on using Word, Excel and office productivity tools - things that kids these days pick up in 5 minutes without any instruction. Governments are now trying to put in place curricula that incorporate coding. It&amp;#39;s quite easy to imagine how a committee designed curriculum might look. Not compatible with the dynamic world of IT and especially not when it comes to learning to code. By the time a curriculum has been worked through and published, large chunks will be out of date and it will be static for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_2"&gt;The Solution : CrowdTeaching &amp;amp; Collaboration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case educators don&amp;#39;t think it can be done, I suggest they take a look at the open source community. It is populated by very smart, community oriented people who know how to code and many of whom are all too happy to try to explain how things work. Take a look at GitHub, which alone has nearly 4 million developers working collaboratively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open source software is at or near the centre of every single great IT company without exception. Ask Google, Twitter, Facebook, IBM, Accenture - open source works and is used extensively. Apply the open source approach and ideals to tutorials and teaching people to code, whether beginner, intermediate or advanced, and you have a recipe for success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone can take any tutorial made by anyone and then &amp;#39;fork&amp;#39; (copy) it and make improvements. These improvements can be small, in which case they are requested to be re-absorbed by the original creator, or they can be the starting point for an entirely new direction. There are no absolute &amp;#39;Owners&amp;#39; as every project is permissively open sourced and can be found and updated by anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_3"&gt;How Codio will enable CrowdTeaching &amp;amp; Collaboration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Codio it about to announce several features that will enable this to happen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a teaching platform and feature set based on the Codio IDE (all completely free) called &lt;a href="https://codio.com/s/blog/2013/04/say-it-with-a-sample/"&gt;Codio:Annotations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a GitHub based content framework for content creation and collaboration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a standard educational license that all content should use, allowing completely unrestricted copying and modifications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an active curation program backed by a Codio staff that will provide guidance and organization for any programming language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a curation feature set within Codio that allows people to categorize, tag and vote, helping learners find the best material quickly and easily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these features, there will be a vehicle for a truly post-curriculum approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_4"&gt;Developers don&amp;#39;t have to use Codio&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though Codio will have a unique and rich set of code annotation and documentation features, we don&amp;#39;t want to force people to use Codio. The Codio:Annotation features can be accessed from a developer&amp;#39;s favorite IDE, but there is no requirement to use Codio to submit content to the GitHub library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_5"&gt;What about Teachers and Teaching&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We aim for these initiatives to be a rich resource for teachers to draw on. As every bit of content is open and collaborative, we expect forward looking teachers to be active participants and take inspiration from others and pass this on. They can structure their own courses around existing materials, always looking to update and use the best content available. We think this will attract the new generation of teachers as well as the new generation of coders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_6"&gt;Turning students on to coding - celebrity coders&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to organize global Webinars and interviews with luminaries from the world of coding. These webinars will stimulate pupils and students to hear straight from the mouths of important software developers why it is such a great profession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_7"&gt;Teach to 30,000 not 30&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaboration is also a fantastic way of bringing the best out of teachers. Imagine a teacher who is doing a stupendous job of motivating their students. Isn’t it a real waste for them to have their brilliance shine only on their own class of students? Their content is available to the whole world and they can even arrange a course or webinar that is broadcast globally. Less collaboratively inclined teachers can still piggy back on those materials and use them with their students in whatever way works best for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_8"&gt;So, let&amp;#39;s act&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that this mini manifesto is the foundation for a revolutionary approach to the way coding is taught and gives access to a truly exciting and lucrative career to huge numbers of students. It is a great thing that developing countries can expand their economies thanks to IT and I don&amp;#39;t know of anyone who begrudges them this one bit. However, it is shameful that complacent western countries stand idly by and watch as IT skills drain away.&lt;/p&gt;
