    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hot on the heels of yesterday&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="/s/blog/2013/05/one-click-deployment/"&gt;release of Codio:Deployment&lt;/a&gt; comes a couple of extra goodies for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up is a slight refresh of the UI. We like being trendy and &amp;quot;with it&amp;quot;, so we tweaked our colours and made the UI a little flatter. We also decreased the height of the top bars, to give you even more code editing space. This, along with a set of all new clean and crisp icons, means Codio has never looked so HOT!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second is the much requested ability to quickly and easily switch modes of the file you are looking at, and an updated line and column count. Both these can be found in the status bar at the bottom of the page, when you have a file open. Codio now supports nearly 100 programming languages, and each one is now just a click away. Of course, we will still automatically detect the correct language for you, but just in case we get it wrong, or you simply want to edit your HTML as if it were Haskell (which of course we all want to do), go right ahead and change it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You have always been able to preview your code from right within the Codio IDE, but this ability to preview was never intended to be a hosting solution for your production apps. We have always wanted to make it as easy as possible for you to deploy your apps. So I am very excited to announce our latest new feature that is available right now to all users. Announcing Codio:Deployment - a single click and your app is deployed to your production environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/s/img/blog/deployment-07f08697.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Codio:Deployment is available to users with admin permissions on any project. You can create one or more deployment targets, which can be used to setup different environments - perhaps for production and staging. Then any time you are ready to deploy your code, just choose the target you want, and click deploy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now we support deploying your projects over FTP, but we do have immediate plans to allow you to deploy to Parse and NodeJitsu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the easiest and fastest way to get started is to host your code right here with us. Powered by Amazons S3 cloud storage, you can host your client-side apps and static content with us. Just choose the &amp;quot;Codio&amp;quot; deployment destination, and hit deploy. No server to setup, and no complex configuration needed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Documentation can be found in the &lt;a href="/s/docs/deployment/"&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;, but it&amp;#39;s so easy to use, that we recommend you simply dive in and give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are really happy to announce the release of Codio:Annotations, and we don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;ll have seen anything quite like this before. It is an amazing way of documenting code where you need to explain things through code examples. Tutorials, APIs, frameworks and libraries are the usual suspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_0"&gt;The problem with tutorials&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tutorials, no matter how well they are written require mental leaps as you read large amounts of text, liberally seasoned with code snippets. Here is &lt;a href="http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/tutorials/events_in_javascript"&gt;a link to a very high quality tutorial&lt;/a&gt; from webplatform.org. Take a look at it and imagine you have to learn from it. Wouldn&amp;#39;t it be great if I had a complete, working project, ready to run and all shown and documented within a proper IDE. Read on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_1"&gt;What it does&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the same material in the Codio IDE with annotations added to it. You can play with the IDE below or &lt;a href="https://codio.com/codio/Oscillating-Spring"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; to see it full screen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three things you should play around with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The blue icons are clickable in the file tree and within a source file; try a few out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press the &amp;#39;Tour&amp;#39; button at the top and you will be given a guided tour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press &amp;#39;Preview&amp;#39; and the App will run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;iframe src="https://codio.com/codio/Oscillating-Spring" width="940px" height="600" frameborder="0" marginheight="20" marginwidth="35" scrolling="auto"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_2"&gt;Learn more&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about Codio:Annotations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/#examples"&gt;See some more examples&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/s/docs/annotations/"&gt;Read the Codio:Annotations documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://youtube.com/v/Fk3eG_eSRPM"&gt;Watch a Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_3"&gt;More to come&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the very first version and we have a lot more features planned. We are especially keen to get your feedback so please make sure you let us have your comments (comments below or using the envelope icon within the IDE).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_4"&gt;Support our campaign&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Codio:Annotations is completely free and we are trying to raise awareness of a campaign we are running to get coding taught in schools. Evil flourishes where good men do nothing (ok, a little melodramatic), so if you think that the state of teaching coding in schools is as terrible as we do, then simply &lt;a href="/s/education"&gt;add your name&lt;/a&gt; to the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are always extremely mindful of ensuring that your Codio experience is as secure and safe as possible. So with this in mind, we just rolled out a change in the way that you preview private projects. Previously, we used a cookie to authenticate such requests. This was done to ensure that only those with read permissions could actually preview. However, this method is prone to abuse and could allow an attacker to preview your private projects, regardless of whether they had permission to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mornings release completely removes this dependence on cookies to authenticate when previewing. Instead, you will be prompted to enter your Codio login if and when you preview a private project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note, that you will not be prompted to authenticate when previewing public projects - for obvious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As you may have read in previous posts, we&amp;#39;re trying to change the approach to IT education and we believe that coding needs to be centre stage - well at least on stage - in schools. One of the great things about coding is that it can be fun and can draw on other strengths and talents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example projects you see below draw on creativity, math, physics and even a smattering of art. We are trying to get people to realize that &lt;strong&gt;CODING IS FUN&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone has cool examples of code that draws on talent and creativity from other areas, please add your suggestions in the comments below this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_0"&gt;Explore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are three simple projects displayed in the Codio IDE (which is live and clickable, so go ahead). Each of these can be run in the browser (press Preview button) and you can explore the code in the IDE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_1"&gt;Tearable Cloth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMPORTANT:&lt;/strong&gt; this is a live IDE, not an image, so explore the code and press Preview to run the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src="https://codio.com/codio/Tear-able-Cloth-Demo" width="900" height="500" frameborder="0" marginheight="20" marginwidth="35" scrolling="auto"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_2"&gt;Multi-Touch Boids&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMPORTANT:&lt;/strong&gt; this is a live IDE, not an image, so explore the code and press Preview to run the code.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This TED talk by Sugata Mitra is truly inspirational. It&amp;#39;s shows that kids in the digital age can learn incredibly well without any formal teaching when they form communities and use their natural resourcefulness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src="http://embed.ted.com/talks/sugata_mitra_build_a_school_in_the_cloud.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are four of my favorite parts if you don&amp;#39;t have time to watch the whole video&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_0"&gt;The hole-in-the-wall computer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sugata tells the story of how he put a &amp;#39;hole-in-the-wall&amp;#39; computer, connected to the web, in a small village in India where the kids had never seen a computer and couldn&amp;#39;t speak any English. He then went away for 3 months and left them to it. When he came back, the kids had not only collectively figured out how to use the computer, surf the web etc. but they had taught themselves English so they could figure out how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_1"&gt;Teaching DNA replication to 12 year olds&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He deposited a hole-in-the-wall computer in another village and then asked kids to find out all they could about DNA Replication, certain that they would fail at this complex task. They didn&amp;#39;t become biochemists but they achieved a 50% score in a test for people 8 years older at a private school in New Delhi with a proper biochemistry teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_2"&gt;The English Accent experiment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An experiment to teach Indian kids to speak English without their usual very strong accents (and therefore improve their job prospects). The solution involved not a second of teaching. He gave them a speech-to-text recognition engine and left them to it. If there accents were not good enough, the computer could not recognize their speech and nothing would come up on screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_3"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that there are some important lessons to be learnt from these stories. Kids will learn if they are given some very basic opportunities. If teachers are not available, well never mind. If you add great, modern teachers into the mix, who are capable of teaching not just their class of 30, but a class of 300,000 - now that&amp;#39;s teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
