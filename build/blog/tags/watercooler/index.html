        <h1><a href="/s/blog/2013/11/pricing/">Codio Pricing</a></h1>

        
        <p>We&#39;ve finally made up our mind about Codio pricing. We&#39;ve tried to make it as simple and as affordable as we can. Read on for more or check our the <a href="/s/pricing">new pricing page</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/s/pricing"><img alt="Pricing!" src="/s/img/blog/pricing-9d2597e9.png" /></a></p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Public projects are free</h2>

<p>This was and will always remain the case. It&#39;s great for open source projects, education or simply playing around with Codio. Sign up for free and there is no limit to the number of public projects that you can create.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Private Projects - $8 per user per month</h2>

<p>This is a straightforward, affordable price. Each user can have an unlimited number of projects for a single low monthly fee of $8. There will be an acceptable usage policy but there will not be anything unreasonable in it.</p>

<p>We expect to flick the billing switch and let you purchase a private account later this month. Until then, you can continue to create public and private projects at no cost.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Organization Accounts</h2>

<p>If you want to include multiple users within an organization for billing and administration purposes, then you can create an organization account. You can then assign users, who will have access to all public and private projects assigned to that organization. You can also assign various administrative permissions to specific users within your organization.</p>

<p>Organization accounts will be available towards the end of 2013 and will be charged for at the organization level. Pricing will be announced as it becomes available.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">Educational Organizations : price to be announced</h2>

<p>Codio is a great product for teaching coding. An Educational Organization allows centralized billing, but it also allows classes and groups to be set up and students can then be assigned to them.</p>

<p>It allows teachers to organize their students and take a look at the code their students are writing. There will also be additional functions such as the ability to spin up cloud servers that are ready to run for students, without the need for them to set up the server stack.</p>

<p>It will be available early 2014.</p>

        <h1><a href="/s/blog/2013/10/ilos/">I Love Open Source</a></h1>

        
        <p>I want to briefly talk about an interesting metamorphosis - otherwise known as gross scope creep.</p>

<p>We wanted to give some sort of acknowledgment and support for the many open source projects we use. What started off as a single web page on the Codio site turned into a few weeks of full-on application development.</p>

<p>The result is &quot;I Love Open Source&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="http://iloveopensource.io"><img alt="header" src="/s/img/blog/ilos-blog-hdr-98fcbd44.png" /></a></p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Video</h2>

<p><a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/75609049?autoplay=1&hd=1" target="_blank">Click here</a> for a really quick overview of I Love Open Source.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">What is &quot;I Love Open Source&quot;</h2>

<p><a href="http://iloveopensource.io">http://iloveopensource.io</a> is a full fledged application (it is itself Open Source and forkable on GitHub) that encourages any GitHub user or organization to publicly state which Open Source projects they use. And in the process of doing so, they have the opportunity to donate something, if they wish, to any of those projects.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Codio Loves Open Source</h2>

<p>If you click the logo below, you&#39;ll see our support page and which repos we use.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.iloveopensource.io/orgs/523c6c7f861be70200000007"><img alt="ilos" src="/s/img/blog/ilos-logo-lightbg-78b1be7c.png" /></a></p>

<h2 id="toc_3">Supporters</h2>

<p>Here&#39;s an example Supporter page with 3 OS projects it&#39;s acknowledging. You can see the person contributes code and cash to the jquery project. You can also see the donate options beneath the GitHub Octocat logo.</p>

<p>You are encouraged to link to your supporter page from your website or README.md file.</p>

<p><img alt="ilos" src="/s/img/blog/ilos-sup-page-063e37f5.png" /></p>

<h2 id="toc_4">Maintainers</h2>

<p>Anyone owning a repo that wants support, whether simple acknowledgments or cash, heads over to the Maintainers section and sets up their donation preferences (Gittip, Flattr, Paypal, Wire etc.).</p>

<p>Now, when people are setting up their support or when anyone sees a support page, they are always gently given the opportunity to donate there and then. See the above image.</p>

<h2 id="toc_5">What about Gittip, Flattr &amp; Paypal etc?</h2>

<p>I Love Open Source does not handle any payments at all. We allow the developer to use their own existing Gittip, Flattr and Paypal buttons. For the record, we do not take any commissions or have any commercial involvement with any of them.</p>

<p>The fact that I Love Open Source is itself Open Source and does not handle any cash transactions means that it can concentrate on acknowledgment in general and providing an easy way to support and donate.</p>

<h2 id="toc_6">Code and Idea Contributions</h2>

<p>I Love Open Source can be <a href="https://github.com/codio/iloveopensource">forked on GitHub</a> so feel free to fix code or add features and issue a pull request. Before you embark on huge endeavours, it may make sense to <a href="https://github.com/codio/iloveopensource/issues?state=open">raise an Issue</a> first here.</p>

<p>Any great ideas you want to discuss or bugs you want to report should be done <a href="https://github.com/codio/iloveopensource/issues?state=open">here in GitHub Issues</a> also.</p>

<h2 id="toc_7">Many thanks to DigitalOcean</h2>

<p>A short but important word of thanks goes to <a href="http://www.digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a>. They have been very generous in providing I Love Open Source with their lovely servers at no cost.</p>

<h2 id="toc_8">Please Support Us</h2>

<p>The only support we ask for is that you Tweet about this project so the word spreads fast. We&#39;re @iloshq on Twitter.</p>

<p>Even better, <a href="http://iloveopensource.io">create your own I Love Open Source Supporter page right now</a> and link to it from your web site or README.md file.</p>

        <h1><a href="/s/blog/2013/04/coding-art-math/">Coding + Math + Art + Physics = FUN</a></h1>

        
        <p>As you may have read in previous posts, we&#39;re trying to change the approach to IT education and we believe that coding needs to be centre stage - well at least on stage - in schools. One of the great things about coding is that it can be fun and can draw on other strengths and talents.</p>

<p>The example projects you see below draw on creativity, math, physics and even a smattering of art. We are trying to get people to realize that <strong>CODING IS FUN</strong>.</p>

<p>If anyone has cool examples of code that draws on talent and creativity from other areas, please add your suggestions in the comments below this post.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Explore</h2>

<p>Below are three simple projects displayed in the Codio IDE (which is live and clickable, so go ahead). Each of these can be run in the browser (press Preview button) and you can explore the code in the IDE.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Tearable Cloth</h2>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> this is a live IDE, not an image, so explore the code and press Preview to run the code.</p>

        <h1><a href="/s/blog/2013/04/sugata-mitra/">No teachers, no problem - an inspirational TED Talk</a></h1>

        
        <p>This TED talk by Sugata Mitra is truly inspirational. It&#39;s shows that kids in the digital age can learn incredibly well without any formal teaching when they form communities and use their natural resourcefulness.</p>

<iframe src="http://embed.ted.com/talks/sugata_mitra_build_a_school_in_the_cloud.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>

<p>Here are four of my favorite parts if you don&#39;t have time to watch the whole video</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">The hole-in-the-wall computer</h2>

<p>Sugata tells the story of how he put a &#39;hole-in-the-wall&#39; computer, connected to the web, in a small village in India where the kids had never seen a computer and couldn&#39;t speak any English. He then went away for 3 months and left them to it. When he came back, the kids had not only collectively figured out how to use the computer, surf the web etc. but they had taught themselves English so they could figure out how to use it.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Teaching DNA replication to 12 year olds</h2>

<p>He deposited a hole-in-the-wall computer in another village and then asked kids to find out all they could about DNA Replication, certain that they would fail at this complex task. They didn&#39;t become biochemists but they achieved a 50% score in a test for people 8 years older at a private school in New Delhi with a proper biochemistry teacher.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">The English Accent experiment</h2>

<p>An experiment to teach Indian kids to speak English without their usual very strong accents (and therefore improve their job prospects). The solution involved not a second of teaching. He gave them a speech-to-text recognition engine and left them to it. If there accents were not good enough, the computer could not recognize their speech and nothing would come up on screen.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">Conclusion</h2>

<p>We believe that there are some important lessons to be learnt from these stories. Kids will learn if they are given some very basic opportunities. If teachers are not available, well never mind. If you add great, modern teachers into the mix, who are capable of teaching not just their class of 30, but a class of 300,000 - now that&#39;s teaching.</p>

        <h1><a href="/s/blog/2013/04/post-curriculum/">A Post-Curriculum approach to teaching programming</a></h1>

        
        <h2 id="toc_0">Does the West realize just how important programming is?</h2>

<p>Countries like India, Russia, China, Vietnam, Romania certainly do! These countries are producing ever more, better quality developers every day. Small wonder as programming is extremely well paid, creative, fun and the developer stereotype is now &#39;geek chic&#39; rather than &#39;spotty nerd&#39;. So, what&#39;s going wrong in the West?</p>

<ul>
<li>In the US, the global leader in tech, less than 2.4% of college students graduate with a degree in computer science - <strong>fewer than 10 years ago</strong></li>
<li>At the UK&#39;s Cambridge University, today&#39;s Computer Science students interview with some web design skills but little knowldge of coding, whereas 10 years ago students were often hobbyist programmers. This problem gave rise to the massively popular Raspberry Pi. (<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/about">This link</a> makes for interesting reading).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.code.org">Code.org</a> was launched in the US to try to address the severe developing problem.</li>
<li>Take a look at the infographic below for some sobering stats from Code.org (sorry about mangling the infographic, <a href="http://www.code.org/stats">here is the original</a>.)</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="Code.org stats" src="/s/img/blog/codeinfographic2-21-1-f2724bcb.png" /></p>

<h2 id="toc_1">The Problem in Schools</h2>

<p>Most school curricula focus on using Word, Excel and office productivity tools - things that kids these days pick up in 5 minutes without any instruction. Governments are now trying to put in place curricula that incorporate coding. It&#39;s quite easy to imagine how a committee designed curriculum might look. Not compatible with the dynamic world of IT and especially not when it comes to learning to code. By the time a curriculum has been worked through and published, large chunks will be out of date and it will be static for years to come.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">The Solution : CrowdTeaching &amp; Collaboration</h2>

<p>In case educators don&#39;t think it can be done, I suggest they take a look at the open source community. It is populated by very smart, community oriented people who know how to code and many of whom are all too happy to try to explain how things work. Take a look at GitHub, which alone has nearly 4 million developers working collaboratively.</p>

<p>Open source software is at or near the centre of every single great IT company without exception. Ask Google, Twitter, Facebook, IBM, Accenture - open source works and is used extensively. Apply the open source approach and ideals to tutorials and teaching people to code, whether beginner, intermediate or advanced, and you have a recipe for success.</p>

<p>Anyone can take any tutorial made by anyone and then &#39;fork&#39; (copy) it and make improvements. These improvements can be small, in which case they are requested to be re-absorbed by the original creator, or they can be the starting point for an entirely new direction. There are no absolute &#39;Owners&#39; as every project is permissively open sourced and can be found and updated by anyone.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">How Codio will enable CrowdTeaching &amp; Collaboration</h2>

<p>Codio it about to announce several features that will enable this to happen</p>

<ul>
<li>a teaching platform and feature set based on the Codio IDE (all completely free) called <a href="https://codio.com/s/blog/2013/04/say-it-with-a-sample/">Codio:Annotations</a></li>
<li>a GitHub based content framework for content creation and collaboration</li>
<li>a standard educational license that all content should use, allowing completely unrestricted copying and modifications</li>
<li>an active curation program backed by a Codio staff that will provide guidance and organization for any programming language</li>
<li>a curation feature set within Codio that allows people to categorize, tag and vote, helping learners find the best material quickly and easily</li>
</ul>

<p>With these features, there will be a vehicle for a truly post-curriculum approach.</p>

<h2 id="toc_4">Developers don&#39;t have to use Codio</h2>

<p>Even though Codio will have a unique and rich set of code annotation and documentation features, we don&#39;t want to force people to use Codio. The Codio:Annotation features can be accessed from a developer&#39;s favorite IDE, but there is no requirement to use Codio to submit content to the GitHub library.</p>

<h2 id="toc_5">What about Teachers and Teaching</h2>

<p>We aim for these initiatives to be a rich resource for teachers to draw on. As every bit of content is open and collaborative, we expect forward looking teachers to be active participants and take inspiration from others and pass this on. They can structure their own courses around existing materials, always looking to update and use the best content available. We think this will attract the new generation of teachers as well as the new generation of coders.</p>

<h2 id="toc_6">Turning students on to coding - celebrity coders</h2>

<p>We want to organize global Webinars and interviews with luminaries from the world of coding. These webinars will stimulate pupils and students to hear straight from the mouths of important software developers why it is such a great profession.</p>

<h2 id="toc_7">Teach to 30,000 not 30</h2>

<p>Collaboration is also a fantastic way of bringing the best out of teachers. Imagine a teacher who is doing a stupendous job of motivating their students. Isn’t it a real waste for them to have their brilliance shine only on their own class of students? Their content is available to the whole world and they can even arrange a course or webinar that is broadcast globally. Less collaboratively inclined teachers can still piggy back on those materials and use them with their students in whatever way works best for them.</p>

<h2 id="toc_8">So, let&#39;s act</h2>

<p>We believe that this mini manifesto is the foundation for a revolutionary approach to the way coding is taught and gives access to a truly exciting and lucrative career to huge numbers of students. It is a great thing that developing countries can expand their economies thanks to IT and I don&#39;t know of anyone who begrudges them this one bit. However, it is shameful that complacent western countries stand idly by and watch as IT skills drain away.</p>

        <h1><a href="/s/blog/2013/03/codio-for-education/">Teaching to Code, Learning to Code</a></h1>

        
          <img alt="Teaching to Code, Learning to Code" align="left" class="blog-img" src="/s/img/blog/code-org-5a3193c4.jpg" />
        
        <p>Having watched the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/nKIu9yen5nc">code.org video</a> and seen what they are trying to achieve, we wondered how cool it would be if we could contribute to this initiative in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we can. We have a great Web IDE and with a little effort, we&#39;ve got a game changer for the way tutorials, documentation and code samples are delivered. We want this to be a free, web based platform that let&#39;s any author of code examples or tutorials deliver their content in a natural way, that doesn&#39;t dumb anything down.</p>

<p>To get you interested, take a look below. It&#39;s a real and fully functioning IDE. It&#39;s fast, doesn&#39;t require signup, can be embedded anywhere and is being aggressively developed. However, as a vehicle for providing working code tutorials and examples, it&#39;s a great start. Once we&#39;ve added our annotation features, we think it&#39;ll be awesome.</p>

<p>Or, <a href="https://codio.com/fmay/Impress/tree/Impress/index.html" target="_blank">click here</a> to see the IDE full size.</p>

<iframe width="950" height="600" src="https://codio.com/fmay/Impress/tree/Impress/index.html" style="margin:20px 0;"></iframe>

<p>Over the next couple of months (with some <a href="http://twitter.com/home/?status=Codio%20web%20platform%20turns%20your%20%23code%20into%20interactive%20tutorials%20%26%20code%20samples.%20%20https%3A%2F%2Fcodio.com%2Fs%2Fblog%2F2013%2F03%2Fcodio-for-education%2F%20-%20gr8%20for%20%23Education%20%26%20%23developers%20" target="_blank">verbal encouragement</a> from the community) we&#39;ll be adding a lot of very cool stuff to Codio, so people can teach and learn in code&#39;s natural home - the IDE. You&#39;ll be able to add guided tours, rich text explanations that pop-up as you explore the project, audio, and even videos that [for example] show screen output when a piece of code executes.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll be able to set this all up from your own IDE as well as within Codio, and it will not interfere with or mess up your code.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">What&#39;s the problem with online tutorials?</h2>

<p>When I say <strong>tutorial</strong>, I don&#39;t mean novice developer tutorials, but also advanced APIs, frameworks, libraries or products.</p>

<p>There are three main issues:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The natural environment for a code project or example is an IDE, but tutorials are forced to show code snippets - often lots of them. A bit like <a href="http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/tutorials/creating_and_modifying_html" target="_blank">this top quality tutorial</a> from webplatform.org. This can mean a lot of mental gymnastics as you read.</p></li>
<li><p>When I&#39;m learning, there isn&#39;t usually any <strong>instant</strong> access to a full, working project, and if there is, it has to be downloaded and installed somewhere. Again, what we would love is instant access to an online or even embedded IDE.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, I usually find myself wanting to run the project, then make my own modifications and run it again. Experiment in other words. You rarely have this facility.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If these problems were solved, with interactivity at the heart of it, it would significantly speed up the way new coding material is absorbed and taught.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Codio:Annotations</h2>

<p>That&#39;s what we&#39;re calling all this. We&#39;re going to make the whole teaching/learning process highly interactive and fun for the learners and the authors. Learners will get either guided tours around the project, or be able to explore the code freely, and get information wherever they are looking. We&#39;ll have more details very soon.</p>

<p>Here are a few key points about the platform:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&#39;s a web platform, so instantly accessible for learners.</li>
<li>Authors and learners can access without needing to signup (no nasty dialogs or screens before you see the code).</li>
<li>There is no commercial catch - any public tutorial or example is, and always will be, free.</li>
<li>It&#39;s great for absolutely any programming language.</li>
<li>It has to work beautifully for school pupils, but equally great for highly advanced stuff.</li>
<li>It will be a great way of adding code samples into any form of API or developer documentation.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_2">Give us some encouragement</h2>

<p>If you like what you are reading, we ask that you encourage us in any way that you feel will help. The best way is to let others know. We&#39;re a small company and doing this requires a fair bit of effort. So feel free to <a href="http://twitter.com/home/?status=Codio%20web%20platform%20turns%20your%20%23code%20into%20interactive%20tutorials%20%26%20code%20samples.%20%20https%3A%2F%2Fcodio.com%2Fs%2Fblog%2F2013%2F03%2Fcodio-for-education%2F%20-%20gr8%20for%20%23Education%20%26%20%23developers%20" target=" target="_blank">tweet something nice!</a></p>
