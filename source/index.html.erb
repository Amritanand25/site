    At Codio we believe developers are lifelong learners but we also believe
    in taking the pain out of teaching programming skills. Teachers and
    trainers can set up class groups in an instant, invite students in,
    assign courses and modules and demonstrate coding through sharing and
    collaborating. Tutorial content can be created and published, remain
    public or private.
