This page contains links to our legal terms and policies. Equally important to us are the commitments we make to you.

  - You own your code, we don't.
  - You own your data, we don't.
  - You are always free to take any code from the Codio platform and export it.
  - We'll do everything we can to achieve 100% uptime.
  - We will never achieve 100% uptime, but when we fall short, we'll explain why and how we'll do better next time.
