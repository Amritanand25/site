title: Billing & Refunds
---
**Effective August 7th, 2013.**

##Billing Information
The Codio Service is billed as a monthly subscription. We collect credit card details within our site but we do not store any credit card information whatsoever. All credit card information is managed and stored by [Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/).

Your credit card will be billed once a month. You should see a clear reference to "Codio" on your credit card statement and in your online statements.

##Centralized Billing for Multiple Accounts
We will shortly be offering Organization accounts that allow one person to take over the billing of other users. This is not currently available but should be before October 2013.

##Cancelations
You may cancel your subscription at any time but your subscrition will remain active until the end of the subscription period. We do not offer refunds for subscriptions canceled partway through a month.

##General Refund Policy
Codio does not offer refunds other than at its own, exclusive discretion. If you wish to cancel your subscription then your subscription will continue running until the end of the subscription period (one month). No partial refunds will be given.

If you wish to assess the suitability of Codio for your needs, then you are able to use almost all Codio functionality without a subscription, under the proviso that your code is publicly visible. If you want to test Codio on private projects (where no-one can see your code except those you invite) then you will need a paid subscription.
