1. Once the blog post is ready in draft format, you should provide us with the link so we can give final approval, which will not be withheld as long as it conforms to the 'What Qualifies' section below.

##What Qualifies
In order for us to accept a sponsored blog post it needs to meet the following criteria

- Must be related to programming
- Must contain a complete set of source code that accompanies the text content
- All source code must be presented as a Codio project within your own Codio account (a free account is fine)

**1.** You must use the appropriate legend for the Mark: Â® for registered trademarks, TM for unregistered trademarks, and SM for unregistered service marks.

**2.** You shall not use any Codio Mark to disparage Codio, its products or services, or in a manner which, in Codio's reasonable judgment, may diminish or damage its goodwill in the Mark or imply endorsement by Codio. You agree to cease all such uses upon written notification by Codio. You agree not to take any action which might lead a third party to think a Codio Mark is owned by you, or which might adversely impact Codio's reputation. You shall at all times use the Codio Marks in a manner consistent with trademark laws.
