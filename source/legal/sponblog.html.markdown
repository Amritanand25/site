**Effective November 14th, 2013.**

The following content describes the Terms & Conditions associated with Codio's sponsored blog arrangement.

##Formal Agreement Required
In order for Codio to pay any form of remuneration to an individual or company with respect to the Sponsored Blog, you need to 

1. send an email to support@codio.com agreeing to these terms and conditions
1. provide a the title of your blog post and very brief abstract of the content

1. Once the blog post is ready in draft format, you should provide us with the link so we can give final approval, which will not be withheld as long as it conforms to the 'What Qualifies' section below.

##What Qualifies
In order for us to accept a sponsored blog post it needs to meet the following criteria

- The blog post's sole subject matter must be programming.
- The post should be such that a source code project forms a useful and important part. 
- The source code project should be presented as a Codio project within your own Codio account (a free account is fine)
- Your blog post should contain at least two clear links to the Codio project (preferably a Codio button). You must use the Codio button 'as is' and may not modify it. 

We reserve the right not to accept a submission even if it meets the above criteria.

##Remuneration
You will be remunerated based upon the number of unique visitors who view the source code project within Codio. You will be able to view the number of impressions yourself from within the Codio IDE.

Remuneration is calculated based upon a pre-agreed amount per thousand impressions. This amount will be provided to you in your confirmation email prior to your blog post going live. In addition, we also offer a payment that is available to you once your post goes live. 

Payments will cease after 6 months of the post going live. We also reserve the right to cease payment once $2,000 has been paid with respect to a single tutorial or project.

##Payment
Payment will be made once per month on the 25th of each month. We will transfer using Paypal or by wire transfer. All wire or other electronic transfer costs are borne by you.

##Termination of Payment
We reserve the right to terminate payment ...

- once $2'000 has been paid with respect to a single tutorial or project.

##Reporting
The Codio IDE provides reporting, so you are able to monitor the traffic associated with your blog in real time. It is exclusively this number that is used as a basis for remuneration.  

##Change of Agreement
Codio may make changes to this agreement from time to time. If we change the Terms in any substantive way, we will give you at least seven days notice before the changes take effect.
