<section id="overview">
  <h2>Codio in Education</h2>
  <p><strong>We're planning to do rather a lot in 2013 helping developers the world over learn how to code. We're doing this by providing a platform and a strategy that helps the development community at large get together to build great content with cutting-edge web based tools.</strong></p>

<section id="annotations">
  <h2>Codio:Annotations</h2>
  <p>Codio:Annotations is one of the main drivers of our educational efforts and will be released before the end of April 2013.</p>
  <p>The best place to find out more is to visit the <%= link_to 'Codio:Annotations documentation', '/docs/annotations/' %> where you can get an overview or dive into real detail.</p>
  <p><%= image_tag '/img/annotations-video.png' %></p>

<section id="curation">
  <h2>Curation</h2>
  <p>Codio will soon be adding a front-end layer that allows the community to collaborate in a Wiki like way on the way that teaching materials are structured and organized. Tutorials can be assigned to places within the curation structure so they can be found easily. We will also offer voting and commenting features so the best tutorials can float to the top and improved through feedback.</p>

<section id="github">
  <h2>The GitHub Project</h2>
  <p>GitHub is the clear leader in open source collaboration projects. Codio will soon be setting up a GitHub project that will be a goto place for tutorials of any kind. It is designed to work fully independently of Codio but the <a href="#curation">Codio curation</a> features will provide a very friendly front-end for students and learners.</p>
</section>

<section id="educode">
  <h2>Educode License</h2>
  <p>We are creating a special license that we will recommend all tutorials and Codio:Annotation projects use. The purpose of this license is to make sure everything is completely open, copyable and leaves people free to improve all available materials in any way they see fit.</p>

<section id="inspire">
  <h2>Inspire Program</h2>
  <p>With the Inspire Program, we will recruit renowned coders from all the world to deliver short, informal, ad hoc talks that aim to inspire the next generation of programmers. These will be in video format and will be published under the Educode License so teachers and collaborators are free to do with them whatever they like.</p>
  <p>Hope the guys at <%= link_to 'code.org', 'http://code.org', :target => "_blank" %> don't mind us using their image. We're all pulling in the same direction when it comes to inspiration.</p>
