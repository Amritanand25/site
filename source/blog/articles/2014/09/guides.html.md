It may look like we have been a bit quiet recently, but we have in fact been building some major features, which will start coming off the production line in the next few weeks.

The first thing we have just brought out is Codio Guides. This is an excellent way of authoring and displaying tutorial content right within the IDE. It is ideal both for teaching new concepts to complete novices as well as building Tutorials for really advanced frameworks, libraries or APIs.

Here's a quick video to show you how it works.

<div class="video">
  <div class="video-wrapper">
    <iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/105219223" width="700" height="430" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>
</div>

And here's a quick summary of the Guides features

- author your content with simple markdown
- specify files, previews or terminal windows to automatically open (or close) when a section appears
- create any number of sections within your Guide
- navigate from table of contents or next previous buttons
- re-order sections with drag and drop
- optionally style your own output with CSS overrides
- highlight blocks of real code from a tutorial section
- choose from a selection of panel layouts

There's lots more so feel free to take a look at the [Guides documentation](/docs/guides)
