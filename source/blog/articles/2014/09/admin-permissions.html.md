Today we're delighted to announce the addition of a new 'Administrator' permission, enabling project owners to assign full Codio box rights to their team members and fellow developer collaborators.

Admin permissions is a feature that many of you have requested and provides a far greater level of flexibility for developer teams. The new feature includes the ability to:

- access the command line in the Terminal
- access and run Deployments from a single codebase without having to set up more complex workflows
