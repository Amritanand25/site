We are delighted to announce an important new feature that a lot of people have been requesting and give a great deal of flexibility to small developer teams

We have now added a new 'Administrator' permission, which allows Project Owners to assign full Codio Box rights to others including

- access the command line in the Terminal
- access and run Deployments

This new permission allows groups of people to deploy from a single codebase without having to set up more complex workflows.
