At Codio we know that it’s often the little things about the interface and the development environment you use that make a big difference to your experience – ultimately it's about choice and flexibility.

So today we’re pleased to confirm that manual save is now an option in project settings. 

As a default, projects are set to save content automatically, which is great, for example, for collaborative development projects, but we know that many developers prefer manual save either through familiarity and preference from other development environments or to avoid race situations.

Version control is of course very comprehensively supported through our Git integration.

To read more about the manual save option, see [saving files in the docs](/docs/ide/ide-general/saving/).
