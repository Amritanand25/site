We've been listening to many of our users who have projects that require boxes to be in a permanently active state, so today we’re pleased to announce the beta for Always-On Boxes.

During this beta period, paid subscribers can enable a single box to be Always-On, where the box will remain active regardless of whether your project is open.  Changing box settings to always-on is simple and easy to do by accessing the “Projects>Settings” menu option in the IDE, or by selecting the gear icon for a project in your Dashboard.

If an Always-on Box is a requirement for your projects but you’re not yet a subscriber - you can also upgrade your account by selecting the “Codio>Subscription” menu option in the Dashboard or IDE.

Beyond the beta we’ll be sharing more news about Always-On boxes including options for more than one box.

[Feedback and ideas](http://forum.codio.com) are always welcome, and you can also follow Codio on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/codiohq) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CodioHQ).
