Codio enhances the mobile app developer experience as Phonegap Build comes out of beta

The Phonegap inside Codio integration simplifies the development process and enhances the app development experience for for anyone seeking to build cross platform mobile apps with standards based web technologies like HTML, Javascript and CSS.

Developers will need a Phonegap account and authentication token - but the development experience will run right inside Codio where you can manage keys, build apps, and upload to relevant apps stores.
