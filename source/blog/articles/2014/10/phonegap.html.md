Today we’re excited to announce that mobile app development gets easier as Codio’s Phonegap Build integration officially exits beta. 

The Phonegap Build integration simplifies the development process and enhances the app development experience for anyone seeking to build cross platform mobile apps with standards-based web technologies like HTML, Javascript and CSS. 

Developers will need a Phonegap account and authentication token - but the development experience will run right inside Codio where you can manage keys, build apps and upload to the cloud for submission to relevant app stores.  Android, iOS and Windows Phone are all supported by Phonegap Build.

We’re always listening to the community and seeking to improve the Codio experience, so keep sharing your [feedback and ideas](http://forum.codio.com), and for all the latest news and tips, follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/codiohq) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CodioHQ).
