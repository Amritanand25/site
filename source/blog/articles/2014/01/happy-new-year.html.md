Happy new year to you all, and we hope you all had a great Christmas. I'm recovering from too much food and drink and pondering what 2014 will bring. As far as Codio is concerned, it's all guns blazing, and we've got [BIG plans](/blog/2013/12/git-and-tease-of-what-is-to-come/). We'll be revealing more over the coming weeks and months.

As for now, we've got a few goodies that we quietly shipped over the festive period. So think of these as slightly belated Christmas presents.

## File Templates

The biggest new feature that shipped just before Christmas, was developed by one of our awesome engineers as part of his Friday Hack Day; a weekly day of anything goes hacking on Codio.

[File Templates](/docs/ide/ide-general/templates/) allow you to create a new file based on a selection of code templates, such as a PHP class, or Python script, or even a plain HTML page. When you create a new file, you will have the option of populating that new file with a template of your choosing.

We already provide several templates out of the box, but if none of those are what you want, you can also edit these or even create your own templates.

This is one of several new features and improvements that we have already shipped, and that came out of our weekly Hack Day. Here's to plenty more!

## Single click directory opening

Another improvement that has come out of us listening to what you want...

If you now click a directory name in the file tree, that directory will be expanded without requiring a second click. This makes things more consistent with file opening. Simply put, it means that a single click is all you need to open a file or directory.

And of course, you can still right-click any item to access the context menu, which includes the ability to rename and delete the item.
