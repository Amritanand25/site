We're now ready with our paid subscriptions for private projects. This has a few implications for existing users and we want to clarify what this means for existing users.

##Public Projects
There are no changes here. If you have only public projects in your account then there is no need to take a paid subscription.

##Existing Private Projects
If you have already created private projects, then we are providing a grace period of 30 days during which time you can keep them private without the need to purchase a subscription.

At the end of the 30 day grace period, these projects will be marked as disabled, at which point you can re-enable them, in which case they will become public. 

If you purchase a subscription, all disable projects will automatically become re-enabled and will be private.

##New Private Projects
If you have not yet purchased a subscription but you want to create a new private project or take a public project private, then you will need to purchase a subscription first.

##How to Purchase
There are two place where you can subscribe.

- From the 'Codio->Subscrition' menu
- When you switch a public project to private (from the 'Project->Settings' menu option)

You will see the following screen where you can enter your credit card details.

##Group Subscriptions
We do not currently offer this but it is planned in the near future. This will allow a company to manage centralized payment for a group of users.

##Purchase History & Invoices
You will be able to find this from the 'Codio->Subscription' menu item. You will see the following screen
