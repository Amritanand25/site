We are extremely excited to announce that with immediate effect, you can now purchase a Codio Subscription! This means that for only **$8 per month**, you can continue to create and keep a **truly unlimited** number of private and public projects on Codio.

This has a few implications for existing users and we want to clarify what this means for you.

## Public Projects
There are no changes here. If you have only public projects in your account then there is no need to take a paid subscription. You can continue to work with as many public projects as you wish.

## Existing Private Projects
If you have already created one or more private projects, then we are providing a grace period of 30 days from now, during which time you can keep these projects private without the need to purchase a subscription.

At the end of the 30 day grace period, these projects will be disabled. To access such projects, you have two choices:

- Switch the project from private to public.
- Keep them private and purchase a Subscription for $8.

If you purchase a subscription, all disabled projects will automatically be re-enabled and will be kept private.

## New Private Projects
If you have not yet purchased a subscription, but you want to create a new private project or switch a public project private, then you will need to purchase a subscription first.

## How to Purchase
There are two place where you can create a Subscription.

- From the `Codio > Subscription` menu item.
- When you switch a public project to private (from the `Project > Settings` menu item).

You will see the following screen where you can enter your credit card details.

## Group Subscriptions
We do not currently offer this but it is planned in the near future. This will allow a company to manage centralized payments for a group of users.

## Purchase History & Invoices
You will be able to find this from the `Codio > Subscription` menu item. You will see the following screen:

## Changing Credit Card Details
You can change your credit card details at any time by going to the `Codio > Subscription` menu item and clicking on the 'Card Details' tab.
