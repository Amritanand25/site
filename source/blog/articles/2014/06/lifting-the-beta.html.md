We are extremely excited to announce that we have (finally) removed the Beta label from Codio, and are no longer in Beta.

It's been a long, hard slog, but we've reached the first big milestone, and we've got loads more to come.

We'd like to extend a huge thank you to all of you who have been a part of this first leg of our Journey. Here's to lots more!
