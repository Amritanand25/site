We are extremely excited to announce that Codio is no longer in Beta. We are extremely grateful to the many users who have worked closely with us over the last months to get Codio to where it is today.

As well as working hard on performance and stability, we've been building some very exciting new features which we'll be announcing over the coming weeks.

So once again, a huge **Thank You** to everyone who has been a part of this first leg of our journey and we look forward to having you with us on the next one!
