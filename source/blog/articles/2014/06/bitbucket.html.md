We are very pleased to announce a special type of integration with Atlassian's BitBucket. If you want see rather than read, then take a [look at this video]() that shows it in action.

Codio is a web based coding platform that combines "out of your way" code editing with an automatically created Ubuntu server that is created instantly for each and every code project. So you can now edit **and** execute front and back end code from any browser.

Having the ability to browse your repos in BitBucket and with a single click access your code in an IDE is great. But having a dedicated Ubuntu server can save significant time setting up a stack ready for code execution or build tasks.

##BitBucket - the market leader for corporate repos
Everyone knows that GitHub hosts most of the world's Open Source projects but BitBucket is the clear market leader when it comes to corporate development that require private repos, the reasons being that [BitBucket's pricing](https://bitbucket.org/plans) is very friendly to corporate developers.

##Integration Details
In BitBucket, a user can browse repos and simply press a button - no git commands - to launch that repo in the Codio Web IDE. In a few seconds the project is loaded into Codio, an Ubuntu server is spun up and editing can begin. 

Codio automatically sets up the Git remote details so, if you edit your code, you can push it straight back to the BitBucket repo from the Codio terminal.

If you have not loaded a repo in Codio yet, you are asked to confirm a user name so Codio can create a free account and associate it with your BitBucket account. If your BitBucket repo is private, then this will remain private within Codio.

You can also manage any number of projects within Codio, so once imported you can switch between any number of projects instantly with the connection to each remote BitBucket repo nicely established.

A paid Codio subscription is required if you have more than one private repo in Codio. If you do not have subscription and try to import further private repos, then Codio screens will give you all warnings and appropriate privact options.

##What Next?
We think that this integration provides not just convenient code access but an entirely new way to make ad hoc code modifications, no matter what machine you're in front of. And for many projects, the instant Ubuntu server opens up all sorts of exciting possibilities.

Codio and BitBucket have made the whole integration as seamless as possible. So, give it a try by clicking on the 'Edit with Codio' button on the right hand side of the page.
