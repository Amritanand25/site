> [Adobe PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com) provides a way for users to create mobile applications using technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It's a free and open source framework that allows you to create mobile apps using standardized web APIs for the platforms you care about.

Applications created with PhoneGap can be distributed to various vendor app stores (ex: Apple App Store) and installed on an end-user's device like any other native application.

**We are excited to announce that you can now build your PhoneGap based applications directly from within the Codio IDE.**

PhoneGap Build is a cloud service for compiling PhoneGap applications. We have integreted PhoneGap Build directly into Codio, so you can build your apps without leaving the comfort of Codio. Assuming your app is configured correctly, and you have entered your PhoneGap Build Authentication Token, building your app is just a click away. The resulting builds are shown and made available within Codio, where you can download and distribute them as you please.

PhoneGap Build in Codio is a Beta release, as it is an early release feature. However, it works really nicely, and avoids the hassle of switching around between services when building your apps.

As always, we need your feedback to help improve the experience, so [drop us a line](mailto:help@codio.com) with your comments, problems or suggestions.

Check out the [docs](https://codio.com/docs/phonegap/) for more info on how to use PhoneGap Build in Codio. If you want to find out more about PhoneGap itself, head on over the [Adobe PhoneGap site](http://phonegap.com/).
