Just a quick note to let you know that we just made it even easier for you to switch panels. Just hit `Ctrl-Alt-Shift` and `Up`, `Down`, `Left` or `Right` to focus on a different panel in the direction of your choosing. Try it, it may just extend your life by a couple of years. ;)

And as always, if you don't like the keyboard combinations we've chosen for you, open up your [Preferences](https://codio.com/s/docs/ide/code-editor/kb-shortcuts/) and you can change them to anything you like.
