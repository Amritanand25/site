Today marks an important milestone for Codio as we announce our commitment to the education sector and the launch of Instant Coding Environments.

**Education Sector Focus**

From the outset, Codio was founded with a mission to help teach the world to code. We’ve been inspired by the capacity of teachers and students alike to both impart and develop knowledge and skills in every way with computer programming.

We’ve also seen how transformatory technology can be to the teaching and learning experience, unlocking new ways for teachers to interact with students and new ways for students to learn independently or in self-organised groups, with teachers playing the role of coach and mentor.

So today we’re proud to announce that Codio’s core focus will be on the education sector, with products and services increasingly tailored to teaching computer programming in schools and universities.

We’ll continue to support all developers – themselves lifelong learners – but Codio is now an education company.

**Instant Coding Environments**

Today we’re also excited to announce the launch of instant coding environments with a library of pre-configured software stacks and starter packs readily accessible to all our users.

We’ve already seen how powerful a cloud IDE can be in removing so many of the pain points teachers and students face when seeking to combine delivery of a programming curriculum with the need for a real coding environment. Stacks and starter go even further in taking the pain out of teaching coding – enabling all our users to instantly access ready made software stacks or starter packs for use in their programming projects.

Now when you visit the IDE – as well as seeing all your projects – you’ll also see “stacks” and “starter packs” in the main dashboard menu.  We’ve got stacks for LAMP, Angular, LEMP, Node, Grunt, Mongo Db, Python and Ruby on Rails to name just a few.

You can select your stack or starter pack from our pre-configured library and be coding in an instant:
-	select from a Codio certified and pre-configured library of software (languages, databases and other components);
-	create your own stacks using our previously released [install software](/docs/boxes/box-parts) option;
-	keep stacks private to your projects or publish a stack for the community;
-	if you can’t find or create the stack you need, let us know in the forum.

**Commitment to Innovation**

We passionately believe it’s possible to create a teaching and learning experience that reflects a real world IDE with a user experience that inspires innovation in education.

We were thrilled to find out recently that our innovation in computer programming education is gaining recognition – with Codio now shortlisted as a finalist for “Innovator of the Year” in the 2015 BETT awards. Take a look at the video below to see our story:

If you’re inspired by what you’ve seen, and want to find out more, feel free to get in touch – we’re always open to [feedback and ideas](http://forum.codio.com) so keep those coming.

If you think your school could benefit from using Codio’s platform you can request an education trial.

We’ll keep building out new stacks and starter packs and we have more exciting education resources coming soon, so stay connected and follow Codio on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/codiohq).
