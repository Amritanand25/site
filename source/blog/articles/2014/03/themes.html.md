Today we shipped a whole bunch of new themes, which thanks to our [tmThemeConverter](https://github.com/codio/tmthemeConverter) was a breeze to do. In fact, these new themes were suggested or created by Codio users.

Open up your Preferences in Codio, or open any project and go to the `View > Theme` menu item, and you will see these new themes.

* Arstotzka
* Bold
* Earthsong
* Frontier
* Juicy
* Mellow
* Mintchoc
* Pastel
* Peacock

*Enjoy!*
