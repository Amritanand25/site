We've just added 2 new guides showing how to install [Drupal](/docs/boxes/specifics/drupal) and [Joomla](/docs/boxes/specifics/joomla) on a Codio Box. Each installation takes only about 3 minutes and the steps are extremely uncomplicated.

The guides cover the downloading of the installer package, installation of PHP and MySQL as well as setting up a MySQL database ready for the systems to connect to.

You can find both guides here:

- [Drupal installation guide](/docs/boxes/specifics/drupal)
- [Joomla installation guide](/docs/boxes/specifics/joomla)
