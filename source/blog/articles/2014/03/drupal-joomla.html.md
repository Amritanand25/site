We've just added 2 new guides showing how to install Drupal and Joomla on the Codio Ubuntu Boxes. Each installation take only about 3 minutes and the steps are very uncomplicated.

The guides cover the downloading of the installer package, installation of PHP and MySQL as well as setting up a MySQL database ready for the systems to connect to.

You can find both guides here

- [Joomla instalation guide](/docs/boxes/specifics/joomla)
