We're currently catching up on user requested Box Parts. Here's a list of Parts we've just added ...

- Open LDAP `parts install openldap`
- Ocaml, Opam `parts install cocaml opam`
- Groovy `parts install groovy`
- Tomcat `parts install tomcat`
- 'R' programming language for statistical computing `parts install r_base`
- MariaDB `parts install mariadb`

Any of these can be installed in a few seconds just using `parts install part-name` from the Terminal window.

We will have more coming out later this week, so keep your eyes peeled!
