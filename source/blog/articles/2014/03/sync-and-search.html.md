It's been a mad few weeks here at Codio HQ, as we have been striving to make Codio more and more stable. We've made incredible progress on that front, but there is always more to do.

This week has seen a whole load of bugs squashed and performance improved, and we've also shipped a couple of improvements that I want to highlight in this post.

## Shiny New Search

The in-project search has always looked good and behaved great, but the in-file search has been a little neglected. So we've given it some Codio love. The search is now much improved and more consistent with the in-project search. It's also much easier to use.

## Sync the Tree

While the synchronisation of the file tree has improved hugely since Codio Boxes were launched, we have still received one or two reports of changes not appearing in the file tree. So while we continue to improve this synchronisation, we've added a little sync button to the bottom of the file tree, and in the `Project` menu. So if you ever see something not quite right in your file tree, click this and you should be good to go.

## Fixed Width Tabs

[You asked for fixed width tabs](http://cl.ly/image/3x1L2l1T233d), and we delivered. All tabs are now the exact same width, which means you can more easily close multiple tabs without moving your mouse around to find the close button. Of course, you could use the keyboard shortcut to close a tab `Alt-W`.

## Terminal Re-Focusing

Switching between the Terminal and other tabs no longer loses focus. So when switching back to the terminal, the focus is back on the Terminal input, so you can start typing immediately.

## Guides!

I should also mention that we have been hard at work on a plethora of [Tutorials and How To's](https://codio.com/docs/specifics/) in our documentation. You may already have seen some in this blog. You can find Guides on using [PHP](https://codio.com/s/docs/specifics/php/) and [Ruby](https://codio.com/s/docs/specifics/ruby/), and even how to install and setup [Wordpress](https://codio.com/s/docs/specifics/wordpress/) and [Drupal](https://codio.com/s/docs/specifics/drupal/).
