You may have noticed a slight change in the file tree - a good one!

Well, on Friday we shipped an all new file tree that is powered by the amazing [jsTree](http://www.jstree.com/). Up until then we had been using a home-grown implementation that we called SimpleTree. But unfortunately, SimpleTree had not been as simple as we had originally intended, and was starting to cause a little pain, both during development and usage of Codio.

The switch to jsTree is largely a technical one, and you should not notice much of a change. But in our tests jsTree has proven to be much more performant. It also has a great plugin system that we plan to take advantage off so that we can enhance the tree and make using it much easier and faster than ever before.
