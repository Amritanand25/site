Many Codio users have lots of projects and have been asking for a better way to locate an individual project. As a part of our Organizations support, which we'll be releasing imminently, we have revamped the main projects dashboard.

##Search
The search feature lets you type any part of the project name or project description into the search box at the top of the page. It will then instantly refine your project listing, showing any matches.

You can also search on other project data such as project owner, private/public status and other fields.

##Column Ordering
You can sort any of the columns by clicking on the column headings.

##Project Settings
Another nice feature is the ability to access your project settings directly from the dashboard without having to go into the project by clicking on the gear icon.

You may notice that we have a brand new feature called Clonable Boxes, which allows you to mark a project as being clonable at the box level, not just the code level. We'll be announcing full details very shortly in another post.
