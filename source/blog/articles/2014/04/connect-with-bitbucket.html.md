You have been able to sign in to Codio using your GitHub account for quite a while now, but as of today, you can also sign in using your BitBucket account.

This will work if you do not yet have a Codio account, and also if you do have an existing Codio account. When you sign in, just choose the **Sign in via BitBucket** button, and you will be taken through the authentication process with BitBucket, and then back to Codio.

This is the first phase of deeper integration with BitBucket, so watch this space as we will be telling you all about it very soon.
