We are extremely excited to announce that this morning we shipped an awesome new feature that a lot of you have been asking for... **multiple cursors** are now available for your editing pleasure!

You can place multiple cursors using `Cmd+Click` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Click` (PC/Linux). You can also use `Alt-Click` to place the cursor everywhere inbetween a start and end position.

You are most welcome! Enjoy!
