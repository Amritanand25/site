Some file types and languages in Codio have more than one mode. For example, Markdown files have two modes: `Code` and `Preview` that you can switch between at any time via the Mode Selection menu in the status bar.

We just improved this and have made mode switching loads faster.

- First of all, Markdown files no longer open in preview mode by default. There is one exception to this, which is the README.md. That continue to open in Preview mode by default.

- There is a new button in the floating toolbar which can be used to switch betwen modes with just a single click.

- And finally, we created a keyboard shortcut for those of you who don't like using your mouse. Just hit `Ctrl-J` (`Cmd-J` on a Mac).
