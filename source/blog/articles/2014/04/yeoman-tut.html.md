Yeoman is a great tool for scaffolding workflows while at the same time mixing in many of the best practices that have evolved within the industry.

It uses three main components

- **Yo** does the actual scaffolding and sets up all your Grunt tasks and pulls in Bower dependencies
- **Bower** - full dependency management
- **Grunt** - build tasks

You can read about all this in full technicolor at [Yeoman.io](http://yeoman.io).

##Our Tutorial
We've taken the [Yeoman Codelab page](http://yeoman.io/codelab.html) and converted all the steps into [Codio Annotations](https://codio.com/s/docs/annotations/). Each step is shown as a single page in the content section (see the right hand pane below). You can then navigate backwards and forwards using the buttons at the top. In the left pane you can run terminal commands or open up and edit code.
