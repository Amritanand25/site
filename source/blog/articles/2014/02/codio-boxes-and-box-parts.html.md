[As previously announced](/blog/2014/01/server-side-development), we have been squirrelling away on something really big over the last couple of months. **Codio Boxes** will provide a full-stack server-side development environment for each and every one of your Codio projects. It's in private beta right now and will be shipping later this month.

A **Box** is an Ubuntu server that's created **instantly and invisibly** to accompany each and every one of your Codio projects. You have full access to your Box via the integrated SSH terminal.

We think you'll be amazed at how transparent and easy they are to work with. There is no complex setup. Your Box is simply there for you.

If you are doing client-side coding then you don't even need to be aware of it if that makes you feel better. But if you run things like Grunt, then having the Box means you can configure and run any build task you like.


## Screencasts

Codio Boxes will support dozens of programming languages, including, but not limited to Ruby, NodeJS and PHP. We've created a couple of small screencasts to show you how easy and fast they are to get started.

Your Box comes with the following pre-installed languages and components:

But we also have a big library of so-called "Box Parts" which let you install more databases, languages and components unbelievably quickly. Here's a selection of the Box Parts we have. If you want more Box Parts, just ask and we'll add them for you quickly.
