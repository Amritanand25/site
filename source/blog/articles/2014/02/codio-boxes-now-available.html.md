I am extremely excited to announce the immediate and total availability of the awesome new Codio Boxes!

**Codio Boxes are a cloud-based, full-stack, server-side development environment** that is tightly integrated with every single Codio project. This means that as well as the immense power of the Codio IDE that you are familar with for developing client-side applications, you can now develop *and run* server-side code without ever leaving Codio.

Every single project in Codio has its very own Box. Each Box is an isolated development environment, running Ubuntu 12.04 and with full terminal access via a secure SSH connection - all right within Codio. Your project's code is mounted to this Box, which means you can manage your files and folders from the Terminal, or continue using the Codio IDE. So if you create a file from the Terminal, it will immediately show up in the file tree of the IDE, and vice versa.

We've updated the [Docs](/docs/) and the site with a new [homepage](/) and [features page](/features).

**Go ahead and try it!** We spent yesterday migrating all existing projects, so all your old and existing projects now have a Box to play with, as well as any new project you create.

## Fast

Create or open a project, and your Box is ready to go. Just open the Terminal and you are in with full access to do what you want. This takes just a few seconds!

## Full Stack

Unlike other online IDE's, you do not have to choose what stack you have on your box. This is because we make it all available to you on every project. [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) and [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) are installed as standard to allow you to install and switch Rubies and NodeJS versions at will, and the [Box Parts](/docs/boxes/box-parts/) package manager allows you to install loads of other languages, databases and other software directly onto your box.

## Customisable

With Box Parts, you can install your language and database of choice, and run it quickly and easily. Check out the [new homepage](https://codio.com/#overview), where we have created a couple of short screencasts that show how fast and easy it is to create your environment.

I could gush on and on about the awesomeness of Codio Boxes, but try them for yourself. We think you'll love them.
