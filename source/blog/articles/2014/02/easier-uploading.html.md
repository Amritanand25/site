We've just made it easier and faster to upload your content to Codio! We've improved uploading in two ways...

## Drag and Drop onto the File tree

Previously, you had to open the upload dialog before you could upload anything. Well, we've removed this requirement completely. While it is still available, you don't need to open the upload dialog at all!

Instead, just drag and drop your files directly where you want them. Drag from your desktop and drop into any directory within your project's file tree.

## Directory Uploading

If you have the latest version of Chrome or Firefox, you can now upload whole directories by simply dragging and dropping them. This allows you to upload more than one file very quickly.
