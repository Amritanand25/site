We have been squirreling away on something really big over the last couple of months and wanted to give you a sneak peak. 

**Codio Boxes** gives you a dedicated Ubuntu server for each of your Codio projects. Read on for the full details.

##Boxes
A **Box** is a Ubuntu server that's created **instantly and invisibly** to accompany each and every one of your coding projects. You have full access to your Box via the terminal.

We think you'll be amazed at how transparent and easy they are to work with. There is no complex setup. Your Box is simply there for you.

If you are doing front-end only coding then you don't even need to be aware of it if that makes you feel better. But if you run things like Grunt for your web sites then having the Box means you can configure and run any build task you like. 

##Box Parts
Your Box comes with the following preinstalled languages and components

- **Node** (with the nvm version manager)
- **Ruby** (with rbenv version manager)
- **Python** 2.7 
- **Git, Mercurial and SVN** SCMs

But we also have a big library of so-called "Box Parts" which let you install more databases, languages and components unbelievably quickly. Here's a selection of the Box Parts we have. If you want more Box Parts, you can just request one here and we will add them for you quickly.

- **Languages**: C,Node, Ruby, Python, PHP (and Composer), Go, Haskell, Java, Lua, Pascla, Rust, Scala
- **Databases**: MongoDB, MySQL, Postgresql, SQLite3, Redis, Memcached
- **Web Servers & Queues**: Apache2, Nginx, RabbitMQ
- **Components**: ack, ant, apr, cmake, geos, swig, ghc, image_magick, Leiningen, mave, s3cmd, Silver Searcher
- **Other**: PHP Composer, MeteorJS, PhantomJS

##Shipping
Codio Boxes is currently in heavy testing. We aim to have it in Production before the end of February 2014.
