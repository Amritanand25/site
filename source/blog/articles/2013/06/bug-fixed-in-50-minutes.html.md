I love how we develop and build software here at Codio. I want to explain quickly just one of the reasons why I love it so much, which also happens to have an immediate effect on you, our users.

On tuesday morning, our awesome QA team reported a bug related to forking projects. This bug was reported at 9:41am.

At 9:52am, one of our equally awesome engineers picked up the bug and began work on it.

At 10:10am is was fixed.

At 10:26am it was deployed and shipped to the world!

From the time it was known and reported, to the time it was deployed to production was only 50 minutes! That is only possible due to the continuous development and deployment processes that we have in place.

I'll try and talk about these processes in a future post. [Follow us](https://twitter.com/codiohq) to find out what else we're up to.
