We pushed even more new features this week. Two of the highlights of these are a colour preview and colour picker, accessible from right within the code editor.

Open any CSS file, hover your mouse over a colour value to see a preview of that colour. Then click the preview popup to show the colour picker. Then find your perfect colour!

It even works with SCSS, SASS and Less files.

Easy peasy!
