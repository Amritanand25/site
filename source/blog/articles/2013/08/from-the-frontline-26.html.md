Happy Friday! ...again

- [Intention.js](http://intentionjs.com/) is a very interesting, but slightly strange Javascript library that offers a way to dynamically restructure your HTML in a responsive manner using HTML attributes. And that's why I don't like it. Ends up dirtying your HTML.

- [Flipload.js](http://pazguille.github.io/flipload/) provides a nice way to flip your HTML elements to show a loading indicator. Works with pretty much any element, which is nice.

- I've seen these [Parallax style effects](http://wagerfield.github.io/parallax/) before, but this library demo's what it can do very nicely indeed!

- Ariya Hidayat writes an interesting [article](http://ariya.ofilabs.com/2013/08/searching-with-array-prototype-some.html) all about searching with Array.some().

- [This article](http://www.mobify.com/blog/css-sprites-vs-data-uris-which-is-faster-on-mobile/) on CSS sprites vs. Data URI's analyses which is faster and more efficient, particularly on mobile devices.

My goal is to try to publish every week day, so I would appreciate any help. If you find anything that you think would deserve a place in future issues, please [let me know](mailto:jmoss@codio.com).
