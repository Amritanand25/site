Quarter of a century!

- Love Handlebars? Love [Swag](http://elving.github.io/swag/)! A huge and extremely useful collection of Handlebars helpers.

- Need to generate a PDF or two? well you don't need the server anymore. [jsPDF](https://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF) will let you generate PDF files in client-side Javascript.

- Seems we have a new UI pattern - nanoscopic progress bars! [NProgress.js](http://ricostacruz.com/nprogress/) is a Javascript library that allows you to create such a progress bar.

- [MobileHTML](http://mobilehtml5.org/) is a nifty site similar to CanIUse, with a focus on mobile browsers.

- DeveloperDrive have written a great post on [multiple backgrounds in CSS3](http://www.developerdrive.com/2013/08/introducing-css3-multiple-backgrounds/), which includes a nice fun demo.

My goal is to try to publish every week day, so I would appreciate any help. If you find anything that you think would deserve a place in future issues, please [let me know](mailto:jmoss@codio.com).
