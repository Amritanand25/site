My last before a long weekend. see ya Tuesday!

- [FlowType](http://simplefocus.com/flowtype/) is a nice library to add to your responsive tool belt, as it will automatically adjust your font size and line height based on element width.

- More responsiveness for you with this [article by Miles Johnson](http://milesj.me/blog/read/responsive-cascading-inheritance) about cascading CSS inheritance with responsive design.

- Tympanus does it again with this amazing tutorial on how to create a [multi-level push menu](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/08/13/multi-level-push-menu/) that slides in from the side of the page. We've seen these before, but the extra touches here make it unique.

- If you have a need to show your users some sort of count, then check out [favcount.js](http://chrishunt.co/favcount/), which is a JS library that enhance your site's favicon with a dynamically changing count.

- Add depth to any element with this [jQuery plugin](http://thepetedesign.com/demos/jquery_flat_shadow_demo.html), that will add a nice long drop shadow.

- [Premailer](http://premailer.dialect.ca/) should be in every developer's arsenal. Give it the contents of your HTML email newsletter and it will show you any warnings that may mean your email doesn't look right in the most popular mail clients.

- [TriDiv](http://tridiv.com/) is just an awesome example of how far browser based technology has come and what you can do with CSS.

My goal is to try to publish every week day, so I would appreciate any help. If you find anything that you think would deserve a place in future issues, please [let me know](mailto:jmoss@codio.com).
