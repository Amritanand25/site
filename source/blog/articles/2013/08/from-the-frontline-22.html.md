Happy Monday!

- "A powerful, easy-to-use, and easy-to-read programming language for the future". Gotta love that as a description of what is essentially just another CoffeeScript clone. [Kal's](http://rzimmerman.github.io/kal/) difference seems to be all about removing callbacks.

- Great article by the guys at [Thoughtbot](http://www.thoughtbot.com/), walking you through how to [write a Pong clone in Javascript](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/58506395118/pong-clone-in-javascript).

- Here's a nifty little [Bootstrap based, visual form builder](http://minikomi.github.io/Bootstrap-Form-Builder/).

- Adobe released an open source Javascript library to help you build [gradient maps](http://blogs.adobe.com/webplatform/2013/08/06/gradientmaps-js-gradient-maps-for-html/).

- [Clank](http://getclank.com/) is an HTML/CSS framework (think Bootstrap), but specifically for building native phone and table prototypes. Great name and can see this as being very useful!

- [Xpressive](http://xpressive.org/) is a CSS3 live design tool for the Mac, that looks very much like developing in Xcode. God knows why you would want to do that.

- Mozilla released [Brick](http://mozilla.github.io/brick/), which is a bundle of reusable UI components created with x-tags, which are simply custom HTML tags. Nice and expressive way to build an app, but a little too unfamiliar for my liking. What's wrong with the tags we already have?

My goal is to try to publish every week day, so I would appreciate any help. If you find anything that you think would deserve a place in future issues, please [let me know](mailto:jmoss@codio.com).
