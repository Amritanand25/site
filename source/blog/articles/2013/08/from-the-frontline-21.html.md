Ok, so it's not that daily anymore. But it's worth the wait ;)

- [Tessel](http://technical.io/) is a very interesting alternative to the [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/); the difference being that it targeted to software developers and runs Javascript (Node) right on the device, with no server necessary. Codio would be perfect for this!

- One of the last holy grail's of CSS; the ability to horizontally *and* vertically center an element. Well it turns out that we've perhaps been looking too hard and it's been [under our noses all along](http://codepen.io/shshaw/full/gEiDt).

- The popular [ToDoMVC just released version 1.2](http://tastejs.roon.io/todomvc-1-2) which includes new frameworks such as Polymer, Flight and React.

- [HTML.js](http://nbubna.github.io/HTML/) is a new library for working with the DOM via a simple DSL. Eerily similar to [Voyeur.js](http://nbubna.github.io/HTML/) which I mentioned way back in [#2](/blog/2013/07/from-the-frontline-2).

- [Detailed article](http://tech.pro/blog/1486/client-side-storage-options) all about client side storage options.

- Webkit just landed an [improvement to for high-resolution](This allows you, the developer, to specify higher-quality images for your users who have high-resolution displays, without penalizing the users who don’t) displays via the `srcset` image attribute. This allows you to specify higher-quality images for your users who have high-resolution displays, without penalizing the users who don't.

- Here's a [nifty little library](https://github.com/sindresorhus/detect-indent) that will tell you the indentation of a given string.

- [Emmet LiveStyle](http://livestyle.emmet.io/) is a plugin for live bi-directional (editor↔browser) CSS editing. Very cool and very likely to appear in Codio in the future.

- The BBC seem to be really embracing open source right now. They just released another [open source library for creating responsive images](http://responsivenews.co.uk/post/58244240772/imager-js), which of course they use themselves.

- The upcoming Firefox 25 will include a new feature called [Blackboxing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaFBvItTJrE) which will allow you to remove specific resources from the step-by-step debugger. Great idea, and nice to see Mozilla starting to innovate more with their browser and its dev tools.

My goal is to try to publish every week day, so I would appreciate any help. If you find anything that you think would deserve a place in future issues, please [let me know](mailto:jmoss@codio.com).
