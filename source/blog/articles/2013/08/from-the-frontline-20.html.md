Number 20!

- [conditioner.js](http://conditionerjs.com/) is an interesting Javascript library that allows you to determine behaviour, and load or unload modules, based on the environment conditions around.

- Need a helping hand building your brand new, all singing, all dancing jQuery plugin? Check out [jQuery Boilerplate](http://jqueryboilerplate.com/) for a bunch of goodies to help you in this endeavour.

- [Validate your JSON](http://pro.jsonlint.com/) quickly and easily, either by copying and pasting, or providing a URL where your JSON can be found.

- If you use MooTools, you'll love [Titon](https://github.com/titon/Toolkit), which is a collection of powerful user-interface components and utility classes.

- If you aren't optimizing your images, and smushing the hell out of them, you can't go wrong with [Kraken](https://kraken.io/), which is a hosted service. If you're on a Mac, check out [ImageOptim](http://imageoptim.com/).

- [App.io](https://app.io/) is a nifty little idea that runs native iOS apps in the browser. Not sure why you would want to actually do that though.

- [Hulk](https://github.com/kevinburke/hulk) is an in-browser visual JSON editor.

- [DalekJS](http://dalekjs.com/) is another UI testing library written in Javascript.

My goal is to try to publish every week day, so I would appreciate any help. If you find anything that you think would deserve a place in future issues, please [let me know](mailto:jmoss@codio.com).
