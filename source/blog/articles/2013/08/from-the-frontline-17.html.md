First issue of the month, and it's chocka...

- Use Less and live on the edge? Check out [Flex.less](https://github.com/codio/Flex.less), which is a collection of Less mixins for working with CSS3 Flexbox.

- [Rocket](http://rocket.github.io/) is a very interesting concept for real time apps, using Server Sent Events (SSE) and JSON PATCH. I'm watching this one closely.

- [Skeuocard](http://kenkeiter.com/2013/07/21/redesigning-credit-card-inputs/) is a genius UI concept for making the input of credit card details a familiar process for the user. [Try it out here](http://kenkeiter.com/skeuocard/).

- [MEAN](http://mean.io/) is a boilerplate that provides a nice starting point for MongoDB, Node.js, Express, and AngularJS based applications.

- The popular Javascript test framework; [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/) is almost ready for a production release of 2.0.0. Check out the [rc2 release](https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/releases/tag/v2.0.0.rc2) and the [release notes](https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/blob/v2.0.0.rc2/release_notes/20rc1.md).

- There are a couple of gems to find this article about [7 JavaScript basics many developers aren't using (properly)](http://tech.pro/tutorial/1453/7-javascript-basics-many-developers-aren-t-using-properly).

- Like Github's user heatmaps? Then check out [Cal-Heatmap](http://kamisama.github.io/cal-heatmap/), which is an open source Javascript lib for creating these heatmaps in your apps.

- The brilliant [JSHint](http://jshint.com) now allows you to put your [JSHint config into your package.json](http://jshint.com/blog/2013-08-02/npm/) instead of the usual `.jshintrc` file. Nice!

- Want automatic notifications when your Grunt tasks fail? [You got it!](https://github.com/dylang/grunt-notify)

My goal is to try to publish every week day, so I would appreciate any help. If you find anything that you think would deserve a place in future issues, please [let me know](mailto:jmoss@codio.com).
