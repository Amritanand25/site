Today, we are very excited to announce an all singing, all dancing, brand spanking new website!

Of course, if you are already looking at it, you can already see how amazing it is. But you should
check out the [homepage](https://codio.com), which has changed dramatically. It's message is much
more focused and now represents exactly what Codio is all about... a browser based IDE focused on
front-end web development; HTML, Javascript and CSS.

And if you are perhaps reading this elsewhere, head on over to [codio.com](https://codio.com) to see
it in all its glory!

Enjoy!
