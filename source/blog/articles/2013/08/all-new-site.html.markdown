Today, we are very excited to announce an all singing, all dancing, brand spanking new website and logo!

Of course, if you are already looking at it, you can already see how amazing it is. But you should check out the [homepage](https://codio.com), which has changed dramatically. It's message is much more focused and now represents exactly what Codio is all about... a browser based IDE focused on front-end web development; HTML, Javascript and CSS.

We also have a new logo and associated icon which you'll start to see popping up here, there and everywhere.

And if you are perhaps reading this elsewhere, head on over to [codio.com](https://codio.com) to see it in all its glory!

Enjoy!
