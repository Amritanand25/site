Kinda' running out of ways to introduce posts...

- More awesomeness from the guys at Square. [Signature Pad](http://szimek.github.io/signature_pad/) is a Javascript library that very elegantly allows a user to sign their name, and then saves it as a PNG.

- [HTML5 Hub](http://html5hub.com/) is a new effort created in partnership with Intel to create a community around HTML5. Hold on though, hasn't this been tried before?Right now, all it seems to be is a blog. Some good articles though.

- [gmaps.js](http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/) is a nice and simple Google Maps Javascript library.

- Time to start using Web Workers in your apps. Check out [Architect](http://architectjs.org/), which is a Javascript library built on top of Web Workers.

- If you use CoffeeScript, along with reactive programming and declaritive UI's, then you'll love [Reactive.coffee](http://yz.mit.edu/wp/introducing-reactive-coffee/) by [@yaaang](https://twitter.com/yaaang).

- Heard about Data-Bindings in Javascript and HTML? Check out [Ractive.js](http://www.ractivejs.org/) which uses a similar concept, but based around Handlebars templates.

- How to [measure performance using YSlow and PhantomJS](http://yslow.org/phantomjs/). Even has CI support.

My goal is to try to publish every week day, so I would appreciate any help. If you find anything that you think would deserve a place in future issues, please [let me know](mailto:jmoss@codio.com).
