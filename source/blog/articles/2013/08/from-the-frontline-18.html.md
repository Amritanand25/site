Welcome to #18...

- Dependency injection in Javascript? [Yes you can!](https://github.com/jcreamer898/bindr)

- If you use SCSS, then this [Gist covering advanced SCSS](https://gist.github.com/jareware/4738651) by [@jareware](https://github.com/jareware) is a must read.

- Lovely collection of some really quite useful [Handlebars helpers](https://github.com/assemble/handlebars-helpers).

- Not sure how useful this is for real world code, but it's cool nonetheless. [Overload](https://github.com/mariusGundersen/Overload) is a simple way to overload a function depending on the type of the parameters passed to it.

- [Promin](http://timseverien.nl/promin/) is a jQuery plugin that allows you to break your form inputs into smaller chunks, while providing a way to navigate through the inputs.

- A somewhat shocking post by [Elliott Kember](https://twitter.com/elliottkember) on [Chrome's insane password security strategy](http://blog.elliottkember.com/chromes-insane-password-security-strategy).

- Beautiful collection of [creative link effects](http://tympanus.net/Development/CreativeLinkEffects/).

My goal is to try to publish every week day, so I would appreciate any help. If you find anything that you think would deserve a place in future issues, please [let me know](mailto:jmoss@codio.com).
