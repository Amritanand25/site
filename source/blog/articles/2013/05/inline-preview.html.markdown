We've just deployed Inline Preview in Codio. You can now press Preview in the IDE and a re-sizable panel will appear beneath your code.

You can expand it in its own tab with another single click.

Read more (well, not a lot more) in the [documentation](/docs/ide/ide-general/inline-preview/).

This is the latest, but by now means the last, feature to come off the production line. Three new ones to be announced in the next few days.
