We are busy adding lots of nice features to make Codio a great environment for Node, PHP, Ruby and Python developers.

One of the important new features is the ability to SSH into a remote server. Sure, you can use your own machine's SSH client, but having it within a Codio tab is really convenient.

You can do pretty much anything that you can do from your command line including running applications like Nano.

###Connection Management
We've also added in a really cool Connection Manager so you can name and save your connections for quick and easy recall.

###Multiple Connections
And because Codio has great panel management, you can have any number of connections open at the same time.

###Documentation
You can read about our [SSH Terminal in the documentation](/docs/ssh).

###Thanks
Thanks to Christopher Jeffrey for his [tty.js](https://github.com/chjj/tty.js) library. We've just donated through [ILoveOpenSource.io](http://www.iloveopensource.io).
