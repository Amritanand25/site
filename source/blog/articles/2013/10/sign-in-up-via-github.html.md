Today we are making it even easier for you to sign up to Codio. If you have a **Github** account, and haven't yet signed up for Codio, just click the [Sign Up](/p/signup) link and you'll see a **`Sign up via Github`** button. Click that and you'll be taken through Github's OAuth process and then brough back to Codio to complete the sign up.

Then when you come back to Codio, just sign in as normal, either via our own Codio authentication or via Github.

Fast, painless and easy! [Create your account...](/p/signup)

We have plans to integrate further with Github and to make it even easier for you to access your Github code, so watch this space.
