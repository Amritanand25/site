Having watched the [code.org video](http://www.youtube.com/v/nKIu9yen5nc) and seen what they are trying to achieve, we thought how cool it would be if we could contribute to this initiative in some way. 

We want to take our very new Web IDE (only just in beta), make a few teaks here and some mods there and deliver something that could change the way code is explained, annotated and documented for ...

- any level of developer
- any programming language
- programming tutorials (novice up to advanced)
- creating stonking, working API coding examples
- adding coding examples to online developer documentation

We won't be adding to the already immense volume of material out there. What we will do is provide an awesome platform that let's people either take existing content or create new content and make it a whole lot better. It'll be available as a free platform for authors and students alike and we would like to have it ready in Q2 2013. Just a couple of short months.

##What's the problem?
There are three main issues with virtually every tutorial out there, whether a regular article or video.

1. You are confronted with a lot of code snippets and lots of text. A bit like <a href="http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/tutorials/creating_and_modifying_html" target="_blank">this very good tutorial</a> from webplatform.org.

1. When I am learning, usually there isn't **instant** access to a full, working project and if there is, it has to be downloaded and installed somwehere. This is annoying and slow. I would really love to have instant access to an online IDE with a single click or even an embedded IDE, a bit like the <a href="#teasers">teaser examples</a> below.

1. I have to make all sorts of mental leaps to see the code snippet that's being explained in the article, then try to visualize it in the context of the whole project, which I can't see. I would really love to have the explanations within the code itself and explore the project freely with in the IDE.

If these problems were solved, it would transform the way I interact with the learning materials. And it is dead easy for the author. I would see annotated code in its natural environment - the IDE.

##Codio:Annotations
And this is what Codio will do. The next blog post on this subject, due out early April, will put real flesh on the bone and show exactly how it will work.

Some of the high level things you might be concerned about and we we want to provide reassurance about: 

- it will work for any programming language
- authors will be able to use their favorite IDE to prepare the annotations
- it will always be free for any public facing tutorial
- no signup is needed to view projects, so access is truly instant

##Teaser #1
Before you get full details in the next blog post, let me show you what already exists that underpins Codio:Annotations. There are no annotation features developed yet, that's coming next.

click on the image below to see what I mean by **instant access**

##Teaser #2
And if you like the idea of the IDE embedded in your article/tutorial, look below : it is a real, functioning IDE. Take a look at index-old.html (the way impress.js is documented currently) and index.html (the way it would look with Codio:Annotations treatment). The annotations.md file contains the documentation in markdown format.

Codio:Annotations will let you click on icons and code segments to take a "what's this" approach to understanding code as well as giving you video, audio and rich text explanations. There will also be a Guided Tour approach to reviewing the code.

##Give us some encouragement
If you like what you read about this initiative, encourage us in any way that you feel will help. The best way is to let others know. We are a small company and doing this requires a fair bit of effort. Feel free to <a href="http://twitter.com/home/?status=Codio%20is%20about%20to%20build%20some%20cool%20stuff%20to%20help%20developers%20of%20any%20skill%20level%20learn%20to%20%23code%20https%3A%2F%2Fcodio.com%2Fblog%2F2013%2F03%2Fcodio-for-education%2F" target="_blank">tweet something nice!</a>
