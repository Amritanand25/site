Having watched the [code.org video](http://www.youtube.com/v/nKIu9yen5nc) and seen what they are trying to achieve, we thought how cool it would be if we could contribute to this initiative in a meaingful way. 

Fortunately, we can. We have a great Web IDE and with a little development effort, we've got a gamechanger for the way tutorials, documentation and code samples are delivered. We want this to be a free, web based platform that let's any author of code examples or tutorials deliver their content in a natural way that doesn't dumb anything down.

To get you interested, take a look below. It is a real, fully functioning IDE. It's fast, doesn't require signup, can be embedded anywhere and is being aggressively developed all the time. However, as a vehicle for providing working code tutorials and examples, we hope it is near perfect.

Over the next couple of months (with some <a href="http://twitter.com/home/?status=Codio%20is%20about%20to%20build%20some%20cool%20stuff%20to%20help%20developers%20of%20any%20skill%20level%20learn%20to%20%23code%20https%3A%2F%2Fcodio.com%2Fblog%2F2013%2F03%2Fcodio-for-education%2F" target="_blank">verbal encouragement</a> from the community) we are going to add a lot of very cool stuff to Codio, so people can teach and learn in code's natural home - the IDE.

##What's the problem?
There are three main issues with most online tutorials

1. The natural environment for a code project or example is an IDE but tutorials are forced to show code snippets, often lots of them. A bit like <a href="http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/tutorials/creating_and_modifying_html" target="_blank">this top quality tutorial</a> from webplatform.org. This can mean a lot of mental gymnastics as you read.

1. When I am learning, usually there isn't **instant** access to a full, working project and if there is, it has to be downloaded and installed somwehere. Again, what I would love is instant access to an online or even embedded IDE, a bit like the <a href="#teasers">teaser examples</a> below.

1. Finally, I usually find myself wanting to run the project, then make my own mods and run it again. Experiment in other words. You rarely have this facility other than trivial examples.

If these problems were solved, with interactivity at the heart of things, it would transform and speed up the way you absorb new material.

##Codio:Annotations
That's what we're calling all this. We want to make it highly interactive and fun for the learners and the authors. We want explanations to be given as either guided tours, or allow learners to explore the code freely and get information whenever they want to. More details in the next post.

Here are a few key points about the platform

- it is a web platform, so instantly accessible for learners
- authors and learners can access without needing to signup (no nasty dialogs or screens before you see the code)
- there is no commercial catch : any public tutorial or example is, and always will be, free
- it is good for absolutely any programming language
- it has to work beautifully for school pupils but equally great for highly advanced stuff (for pro developers, too)
- it will be a great way of adding code sample into any form of API or developer documentation

##Teaser #1 - instant access to your code example
In the next blogs post (early April), I am going to show you how it will work, with screenshoots and a video. Before I do, though, let me show you what already exists that underpins Codio:Annotations. Please note that there are no annotation features developed yet, that's coming next.

##Teaser #2 - even more instant access
And if you like the idea of the IDE embedded in your article/tutorial, look below : it is a real, functioning IDE. Take a look at index-old.html (the way impress.js is documented currently) and index.html (the way it would look with Codio:Annotations treatment). The annotations.md file contains the documentation in markdown format.

Codio:Annotations will let you click on icons and code segments to take a "what's this" approach to understanding code as well as giving you video, audio and rich text explanations. There will also be a Guided Tour approach to reviewing the code.

##Give us some encouragement
If you like what you read about this initiative, encourage us in any way that you feel will help. The best way is to let others know. We are a small company and doing this requires a fair bit of effort. Feel free to <a href="http://twitter.com/home/?status=Codio%20is%20about%20to%20build%20some%20cool%20stuff%20to%20help%20developers%20of%20any%20skill%20level%20learn%20to%20%23code%20https%3A%2F%2Fcodio.com%2Fblog%2F2013%2F03%2Fcodio-for-education%2F" target="_blank">tweet something nice!</a>
