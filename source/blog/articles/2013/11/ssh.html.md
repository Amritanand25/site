Codio has been focusing on building front-end applications. However, we've been busy adding lots of awesome features to make Codio a great environment for Node, PHP, Ruby and Python developers. One of the important new features is the ability to SSH into a remote server without ever leaving Codio.

You can do pretty much anything that you can do from any terminal client including running applications like Nano, Emacs and Vim.

## Connection Management
We've also added in a Connection Manager so you can name and save your connections for quick and easy recall. You can even upload the Codio public key with a button click to save you the time and effort of manually adding keys.

## Multiple SSH Connection Tabs
And because Codio has great panel management, you can have any number of connections open at the same time and arrange them in any way you want.

## Documentation
You can read about our [SSH Terminal in the documentation](/docs/ssh).
