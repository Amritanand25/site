Here's a little goodie for you... we just added an all new theme called MBO:

![MBO Theme](blog/mbo-theme.png)

To change your theme, click the `Codio > Preferences... > User` menu item. You will then see the [preferences editor](/docs/settings-prefs/codio-prefs/). Just add these few lines to the left side of the editor:

```ini
[editor]
theme = mbo
```

Enjoy!
