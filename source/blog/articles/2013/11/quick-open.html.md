Quick open (default is `Cmd+O`/`Ctrl+O`) also known as fast open, is a great way of opening files without the need to access the file tree. Press `Cmd+O`/`Ctrl+O` or select `File >Open File` from the menu and the quick open dialog will appear.

You can now start typing the name of a file and as you type, the list will be filtered. You can then select the file you want using the mouse or use the keyboard, pressing `Enter` on the required file.
