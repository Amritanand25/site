Quick open, also known as fast open, is a fast way of opening files without the need to access the file tree. Press `Alt+U` or select `File > Open File` from the menu and the quick open dialog will appear.

You can now start typing the name of a file and as you type, the list will be filtered. You can then select the file you want using the mouse or use the keyboard, pressing `Enter` on the required file.
