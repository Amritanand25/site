Up until now, you have been able to use auto-complete for Javascript, HTML and CSS using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl-Space`. Well now, you can use auto-complete for any language in Codio!

Codio will track common keywords in the file you are editing, and provide auto-completion for them all. Just hit `Ctrl-Space` at any time while editing and you will be shown a list of common keywords. And if you type the first few characters of a keyword and hit `Ctrl-Space`, you will be shown matches for the characters you just entered.

We will soon have the ability to automatically show matches without requiring you to hit the keyboard shortcut.

### Did you know...?

Did you know that you can customise the auto-complete keyboard shortcut, and in fact any other shortcuts that we provide? Open up your preferences (`Codio > Preferences`) and simply override any of the default shortcuts with whatever you want. [Read the docs for more](/docs/ide/code-editor/kb-shortcuts/).

Enjoy!
