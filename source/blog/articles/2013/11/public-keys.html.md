Our focus is to make all aspects of the development process as smooth and easy as it possibly can be. Once small but great example of something that is a real pain in the ass is the business of deploying public keys to a remote server.

##Why are they needed?
Codio has two main features that require access to remote servers

- SSH Terminal - you can create and manage any number of remote servers directly from Codio. There's a [blog post](/blog/2013/11/ssh/) on this and you can also [read the docs](/docs/ssh).
