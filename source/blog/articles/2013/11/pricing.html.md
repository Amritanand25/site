We've finally made up our mind about Codio pricing. We've tried to make it as simple and as affordable as we can.

##Public projects are free
This was and will always remain the case. It's great for open source projects, education or simply playing around with Codio. Sign up for free and there is no limit to the number of public projects that you can create.

##Private Projects - $8 per user per month
This is a straightforward, affordable price. Each user can have an unlimited number of projects for a single low monthly fee of $8. There will be an acceptable usage policy but there will not be anything unreasonable in it.

We expect to flick the billing switch and let you purchase a private account later this month. Until then, you can continue to create public and private projects at no cost.

##Organization Accounts
If you want to include multiple users within an organization for billing and administration purposes, then you can create an organization account. You can then assign users, who will have access to all public and private projects assigned to that organization. You can also assign various administrative permissions to specific users within your organization.

Organization accounts will be available towards the end of 2013 and will be charged for at the organization level. Pricing will be announced as it becomes available.

##Educational Organizations : price to be announced
Codio is a great product for teaching coding. An Educational Organization allows centralized billing, but it also allows classes and groups to be set up and students can then be assigned to them.

It allows teachers to organize their students and take a look at the code their students are writing. There will also be additional functions such as the ability to spin up cloud servers that are ready to run for students, without the need for them to set up the server stack.

It will be available early 2013.
