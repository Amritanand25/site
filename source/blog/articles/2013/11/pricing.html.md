We've finally made up our mind about Codio pricing. We've tried to make it simple and affordable.

##Public projects are free
This was and will always remain the case. It's great for open source work, education or simply playing around with Codio.

##Private Projects - $8 per user per month
This is a straightforward, affordable price. Each user can have unlimited projects. There will be an acceptable usage policy but there will be not be anything unreasonable in it.

You can purchase a private account from approximately mid November 2013.

##Organization Accounts
If you want to include multiple users within an organization for billing and administration purposes, then you can create an organization account. You can then assign users, who will have access to all public and private projects assigned to the organization. You can also assign various administrative permissions to specific users within your organization.

Organization accounts will be available towards the end of 2013 and will be charged for at the organization level. Pricing will be announced as it becomes available.

##Educational Organizations : price to be announced
Codio is a great product for teaching coding. An Educational Organization allows centralized billing, but it also allows Classes and Groups to be set up and Student users can then be assigned to them.

It allows teachers to organize their students and take a look at the code their students are writing. There will also be additional functions such as the ability to spin up cloud servers that are ready to run for students, without the need for them to set up the server stack.

It will be available early in 2013.
