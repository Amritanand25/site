You've been asking and we've been listening. So today we made it easy to quickly switch tabs without having to use your mouse. Just hitting `Alt-Shift+.` will switch your current tab to the next on the right, and `Alt-Shift+,` will switch to tab on the left.

And of course, if you don't like those keybindings, open up your [preferences](https://codio.com/p/preferences) and change the `tab_switch_left` and `tab_switch_right` item.
