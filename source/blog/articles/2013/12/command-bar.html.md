If you're a Sublime Text user, you'll probably use the Command Bar option. This is a great way to access all commands from a single keyboard shortcut rather than using the menu. 

And if you don't know the keyboard shortcut for a particular command, it's a very fast way of discovering it without searching the menu or docs.

Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shft+P` (PC/Linux) and window will appear. You now just type any part of the command you're looking for and the list will narrow down to match your input. Press `enter` or click on the command and it will appear instantly.

As well as being able to access everything you can find in the menu, you can also toggle various settings and trigger anything that can be accessed by a keyboard shortcut.
