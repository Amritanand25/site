If you're a Sublime Text user, you'll probably use the Command Palette (`Cmd-Shift-P`). This is a great way to access all commands from a single keyboard shortcut rather than digging around and trying to find what you want in all the various menu options. And if you don't know the keyboard shortcut for a particular command, it's a very fast way of discovering it without searching the menu or docs.

We're excited to tell you that Codio now has its very own [Command Bar](/docs/command-bar)!

Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shft+P` (PC/Linux) and the Command Bar will appear. Just type any part of the command you're looking for and the list will narrow down to match your input. Press `enter` or click on the command and it will be executed instantly.

As well as being able to access everything you can find in the menu, you can also toggle a few common preferences, and trigger anything that can be accessed by a keyboard shortcut.
