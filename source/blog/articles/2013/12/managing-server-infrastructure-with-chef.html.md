As we grow, we inevitably grow our servers, and that increases complexity. Our second phase of world domination is also causing this all to increase even further. So I found my perfect excuse to play with Chef, and I have not been disappointed.

> Chef is a systems and cloud infrastructure automation framework that makes it easy to deploy servers and applications to any physical, virtual, or cloud location, no matter the size of the infrastructure.

If you think of Chef as unit tests for your servers, you'll be well on your way.

It's been a hell of a journey, but we are now well on our way to having our entire infrastructure configured completely with Chef, so I wanted to talk a little about how we use Chef at **Codio**.
