Codio already provides a [high level of customisation](/docs/settings-prefs/prefs-list/), because we know that every developer works differently and you all have your own way of working. The [Preferences system](https://codio.com/s/docs/settings-prefs/) in Codio is based on an INI file, which makes it extremely easy to edit your prefs. It's just like writing code, which of course we all like doing.

But there are a few common preferences that tend to get used more than others, so we've made these even easier for you to access and edit. Check out the new and improved `View` menu. You can now change the following directly from this menu:

- theme
- font size
- wrapping
- soft tabs
- tab size

Codio - now even more convenient!
