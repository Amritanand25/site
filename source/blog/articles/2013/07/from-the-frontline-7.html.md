 - A great selection of **[front-end optimisations you can start doing right now](http://odiseo.net/javascript/front-end-optimizations-you-can-do-right-now-on-your-existing-code)**.

 - Not sure why we would want **yet another Javascript framework**, but [Minified](http://minifiedjs.com/) is less than 4kb in size, so at least it lives up to its name.

 - Oh and look... **another new JS framework** called [Q.js](https://github.com/EGreg/Q.js) that contains "a lot of useful Javascript functions"!

 - [Great article](http://css-tricks.com/the-extend-concept/) on CSS-Tricks about **the extend concept** in the three big CSS preprocessors.

 - **Need help with your CSS animations?** [Stylie](http://jeremyckahn.github.io/stylie/) is a fun CSS animation tool that could save you time, and might just be what you need.

 - David Walsh does it again... again - **[9 mind blowing WebGL demos](http://davidwalsh.name/webgl-demos)**. (the Chrome world maze is my fave!)

My goal is to publish every week day, so I would appreciate any help. If you find anything that you think would deserve a place in future issues, please [let me know](mailto:jmoss@codio.com).
