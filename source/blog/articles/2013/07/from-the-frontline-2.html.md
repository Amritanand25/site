**Issue #2 baby!** Some real juicy ones today...

 - **[Voyeur.JS](http://dunxrion.github.io/voyeur.js/)** is an extremely nice library that lets you traverse the DOM like you would any Javascript object. For example `Voyeur.div` finds the divs in your HTML, and `Voyeur.div.section` finds the sections in your divs.

 - Lots of buzz surrounding FirefoxOS recently, although I'm not convinced they can do any better than Android. But what I do like is that everything is HTML, Javascript and CSS, which makes it extremely accessible to every developer. The **[Building Firefox OS](http://buildingfirefoxos.com/)** site is great place to find out more and get started.

 - **[ShareFest](https://github.com/Peer5/ShareFest)** is a web based P2P file sharing library built in NodeJS and on top of WebRTC. Basically means you can replace Dropbox with your own P2P file storage solution.

 - Another CoffeeScript pretender, but this time with a better name; **[GorillaScript](http://ckknight.github.io/gorillascript/)** s similar to CoffeeScript in that it is trying to *fix* Javascript, but seems to be concentrating on preventing common errors often encountered with Javascript.

 - **[JSX](http://jsx.github.io/)** claims to be a "*a faster, safer, easier JavaScript*", but looks like it's trying to be too Java like. I like it's aims though.

 - I use the excellent [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash) for browsing and searching the docs for almost any framework and library you can imagine. **[DevDocs](http://devdocs.io/)** is similar, but web based, which I really like the idea of. It's faily new so it has a limited set of docs right now, so I hope to see these grow to Dash's proportions.

 - Stumbled upon **[Balloon](https://balloon.io/)** yesterday and really like their implementation of web site contact forms.

 - And finally, I came across this [StackOverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17527870/how-does-trello-access-the-users-clipboard/17528590#17528590) asking how [Trello](https://trello.com/) magically allow you to **copy the URL of a card just by pressing `Ctrl-C`**, and all without any Flash. The answer, by Trello employee Daniel LeCheminant, is so simple it makes you feel stupid that you didn't think of it.

My goal is to publish every week day, so I would appreciate any help. If you find anything that you think would deserve a place in future issues, please [let me know](mailto:jmoss@codio.com).
