A new week, another five issues...

 - [StructuredJS](http://khan.github.io/structuredjs/) is a JS library that provides an **interface for checking the structure of your code**. Written by the Khan Academy to teach coding, but I'm not so sure how useful this is elsewhere.

 - **Writing documentation should be easy**, [Daux.io](http://daux.io/) does a pretty good job of that by basing it on a simple document structure and Markdown files.

 - I see a lot of demos demonstrating the power of the latest JS/HTML/CSS, but this one of a **[Minion written only in HTML and CSS](http://cssdeck.com/labs/pure-css-minion)** is just freakin' awesome!

 - If you like the life-saving PhantomJS, then you'll love [PhantomCSS](https://github.com/Huddle/PhantomCSS), which is "An integration of Resemble.js with PhantomJS and CasperJS for **automating visual regression testing of Website styling** to support refactoring of CSS". A mouthful, but still pretty cool.

 - It's amazing how extremely useful **Chrome's Dev Tools** have become. This [post on HTML5 Rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/revolutions2013/), recaps the latest and greatest, including **Workspaces, SASS debugging, Flame Charts and remote debugging**.

 - Building in Open Source? If so, you should check out [ChooseALicense.com](http://choosealicense.com/); a new site from the Github guys, which **helps you decide which OSS license to use**.

My goal is to publish every week day, so I would appreciate any help. If you find anything that you think would deserve a place in future issues, please [let me know](mailto:jmoss@codio.com).
