Here's today's juicy bundle of links...

 - I mentioned the emerging **[Effekt.css](http://h5bp.github.io/Effeckt.css/dist/)** back in issue #1, but it seems they've been busy and we now have a good number of [effects](http://h5bp.github.io/Effeckt.css/dist/) ready to go.

 - While researching ways to improve Codio's own internal **Javascript routing** system, I came across [Router.js](https://github.com/tildeio/router.js), which is the router that [EmberJS](http://emberjs.com/) uses. It's a very thorough implementation.

 - Lots of talk around **ES6**, the next version of EcmaScript (Javascript), but this [slideshow](http://www.slideshare.net/domenicdenicola/es6-the-awesome-parts) talks about **the awesome parts**.

 - [screenfull.js](https://github.com/sindresorhus/screenfull.js) is a tiny wrapper for **cross-browser usage of the Javascript fullscreen API**, which lets you bring the page or any element into fullscreen.

 - [Nice post](http://the-taylors.org/blog/2013/07/01/how-will-i-keep-javascript-code-quality-hight-jshint/) by our friend Dave Taylor on the awesomeness that is **JSHint**.

 - [Later.js](http://bunkat.github.io/later/) claims to be the **simplest way to work with recurring schedules**. If you're only talking about Javascript, then they're probably right.

My goal is to publish every week day, so I would appreciate any help. If you find anything that you think would deserve a place in future issues, please [let me know](mailto:jmoss@codio.com).
