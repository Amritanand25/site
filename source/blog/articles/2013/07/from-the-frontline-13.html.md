Lovin' it...

 - [VerbalExpressions](https://github.com/jehna/VerbalExpressions) is a very interesting alternative to regular expression matching in Javascript, by providing a DSL style API.

 - [Ajax Replay](http://mbradshawabs.github.io/ajaxreplay/) is a great way to test your Ajax API calls by replaying your actual Ajax calls. If you know the VCR Ruby Gem, this is a similar thing but for Javascript.

 - Now this is freakin' awesome! In fact, they are [Awesome devices built in HTML and CSS](http://labs.jaredhardy.com/minimal-devices/). No images to see here.

 - [Bone.io](http://bone.io/) is a lightweight framework for building high performance Realtime Single Page HTML5 Apps. I think we may have heard that one before, but this one seems to centred around WebSockets instead of traditional Ajax.

 - Nice [article](http://matthewlehner.net/ember-js-routing-and-views) attempting to simplify and explain Ember.js's routing and rendering.

My goal is to publish every week day, so I would appreciate any help. If you find anything that you think would deserve a place in future issues, please [let me know](mailto:jmoss@codio.com).
