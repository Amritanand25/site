I neglected to post on Friday, so today is a bumper double issue thingy...

 - Need to **track and report on your Javascript exceptions**? You won't get better than [Errorception](http://errorception.com/), which we use ourselves.

 - Like JSHint? Then you should love [ESHint](http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2013/07/16/introducing-eslint/), which is a **linting tool where all rules are pluggable**.

 - Need to **expand and collapse blocks of text** with a link? Check out [ReadMore.js](http://jedfoster.github.io/Readmore.js/).

 - Oh look! **Another "Bootstrap wannabe" CSS framework**, this time called [Cardinal](http://cardinalcss.com/), which apparently is small and mobile first.

 - [Spectacular](http://abe33.github.io/spectacular/) is a good looking **[RSpec](http://rspec.info/) inspired BDD framework** for Javascript and CoffeeScript.

 - Need to run **A/B tests**? [easyAB](http://srom.github.io/easyAB/) is a jQuery/Zepto plugin may be just want you need.

 - Give users **real time hints and progress updates as they complete your forms** with [Progression.js](http://git.aaronlumsden.com/progression/).

 - WebRTC is one of the most technically advanced offerings to become built right into the browser. **[simpleWebRTC](http://simplewebrtc.com/) might just make it a little easier** to implement.

 - Great article **[In defence of Javascript's Constructors](http://www.2ality.com/2013/07/defending-constructors.html)**.

My goal is to publish every week day, so I would appreciate any help. If you find anything that you think would deserve a place in future issues, please [let me know](mailto:jmoss@codio.com).
