And here endeth our final day of the week, and the fifth issue...

 - Been working with Media Queries for the redesign of this site, and came across a need to **react to media queries in Javascript**. Unfortunately that's not possible, because it's only CSS. I found [enquire.js](http://wicky.nillia.ms/enquire.js/) does exactly that. Bonus!

 - A little gem of an [article](http://blog.mattbailey.co/post/50337824984/grunt-synchronised-testing-between-browsers-devices) for running **synchronised testing between browsers/devices** using Grunt.

 - **[Eddy is a nifty little Javascript Event library](https://github.com/WebReflection/eddy)** that gives the familiar `on`, and `off` methods but on any and every Object.

 - Chrome Developer Tools just keep getting better and better. In the latest [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/canary.html), you'll find a awesome feature called [Snippets](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/authoring-development-workflow#snippets), which let you **save and reuse small bits of code within the console**. Kind of like the [Snippets](https://codio.com/s/docs/ide/emmet/snippets/) that we have available in Codio, but not awesome!

 - [TreeModel](http://jnuno.com/tree-model-js/) A very intuitive Javascript library for **manipulating and traversing tree-like structures**. It has some great demo's on its [site](http://jnuno.com/tree-model-js/).

 - An oldie, but a goodie... [This is Responsive](http://bradfrost.github.io/this-is-responsive/) is a site full of **patterns, resources and new for creating responsive web experiences**.

 - And finally, a nice little [nugget](http://blog.alexmaccaw.com/queuing-ajax-requests) for **queuing your Ajax requests**.

My goal is to publish every week day, so I would appreciate any help. If you find anything that you think would deserve a place in future issues, please [let me know](mailto:jmoss@codio.com).
