A little quiet today...

 - Lovely little [bookmarklet or DevTools snippet](https://github.com/sindresorhus/log-globals) for Chrome that **logs your global Javascript variables to the console**.

 - Completely useless, but awesome nonetheless, [face to gif](http://hdragomir.github.io/facetogif/) lets you **record yourself and produces an animated gif**.

 - [responseImg](http://etiennetalbot.github.io/responsImg) is a jQuery plugin that **turns your `img` tags into responsive images with retina alternatives**.

 - Really love these **[CSS3 animated books](http://tympanus.net/Development/AnimatedBooks/index.html)**.
