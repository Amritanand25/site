Enjoy issue #3...

 - **[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) released their [Datastore API](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/datastore) yesterday**. I think this has huge potential and really opens the door even wider for developers to build on top of Dropbox. Dropbox is becoming more like a platform for developers.

 - **[Chrome 28](http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/stable-channel-update.html) is out!** This is the first version of Chrome that ships with Blink; Google's fork of Webkit.

 - [Nice article](https://medium.com/what-i-learned-building/b4daab987fb0) on how to **get started with CSS source maps and in-browser SASS editing**.

 - **Need quick, easy and fast site search? Check out [Swiftype](https://swiftype.com/)**. Nice to see that Google haven't knocked all the little guys out the park.

 - **[PouchDB](http://pouchdb.com/) is a tiny little database based on, and compatible with CouchDB**. It's a Javascript library, so runs in the browser, but what interests me is that it can sync data with any CouchDB server, and you can even sync between two PouchDB databases!

 - Want to know more about **Web Workers and concurrency in Javascript**? Well [this detailed article](http://typedarray.org/concurrency-in-javascript/) by TypedArray is required reading.

My goal is to publish every week day, so I would appreciate any help. If you find anything that you think would deserve a place in future issues, please [let me know](mailto:jmoss@codio.com).
