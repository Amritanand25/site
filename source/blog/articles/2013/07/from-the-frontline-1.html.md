I use Twitter - a lot! I also follow and read a lot of blogs and tech news sites. Each day I come across so many useful and interesting articles, libraries, code, apps, frameworks and all manner of coolness. A lot of these are directly or indirectly related to developing for and in the browser - what is sometimes referred to as client-side or front-end development for the web.

So, welcome to the very first issue of "From the Front-line"; a regular series of short blog posts which expose the cool side of front end web development.

 - **[Basic JavaScript: an introduction to the language](http://www.2ality.com/2013/06/basic-javascript.html)** - A great starting point for anyone wanting to learn the basics of our best friend; Javascript. Lengthy but worth the read.

 - **[Add rules to your Stylesheets with Javascript](http://davidwalsh.name/add-rules-stylesheets)** - Interesting way to style things by adding rules directly to your stylesheets instead of to the DOM, while still using Javascript.

 - There's a brand new effort to build a CSS animations library that is UI-less and performant. **[Effekt.css](https://github.com/h5bp/Effeckt.css)** is taking shape nicely and is something that I'm keeping a close eye on. You can see a [work-in-progress demo](http://h5bp.github.io/Effeckt.css/). Still plenty to do though ;)

 - **[Topcoat](http://topcoat.io) 0.5.1 is released** along with [usage guidelines](http://topcoat.io/topcoat/) which shows off what the Bootstrap competitor has to offer. Looking good, but perhaps a little too Adobe-like for my tastes.

 - **Brand new bug fix [releases for jQuery](http://blog.jquery.com/2013/07/03/jquery-1-10-2-and-2-0-3-released/)**.  1.10.2 and 2.0.3 are now available to download.

 - **[EmberPress](http://emberpress.eviltrout.com/)** is a clone of the popular [LetterPress](http://www.atebits.com/letterpress/) iOS app, but written with the increasingly popular [EmberJS](http://emberjs.com). I love the fact that the [annotated source code](http://emberpress.eviltrout.com/docs/emberpress.html) is available, which uses the brilliant [Docco](http://jashkenas.github.io/docco/).

My goal is to try to publish every week day, so I would appreciate any help. If you find anything that you think would deserve a place in future issues, please [let me know](mailto:jmoss@codio.com).
