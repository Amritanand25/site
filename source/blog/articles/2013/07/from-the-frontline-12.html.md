Short and sweet...

 - [Operative](https://github.com/padolsey/operative) is a small JS utility for seamlessly creating Web Worker scripts.

 - [More Git and Github secrets](http://zachholman.com/talk/more-git-and-github-secrets/) from Zach Holman.

 - An old one, but this [post on advanced Grunt tooling](http://chrisawren.com/posts/Advanced-Grunt-tooling) is a must read if you use Grunt - which of course you doing so. Aren't you!?

 - The guys behind [Topcoat](http://topcoat.io/) have integrated the [Effeckt.css library](http://h5bp.github.io/Effeckt.css/dist/). Just [a](http://topcoat.io/Topcoat-Effeckt.css/dist/buttons.html) [few](http://topcoat.io/Topcoat-Effeckt.css/dist/list-scroll.html) [demos](http://topcoat.io/Topcoat-Effeckt.css/dist/modals.html), but nice nonetheless.

My goal is to publish every week day, so I would appreciate any help. If you find anything that you think would deserve a place in future issues, please [let me know](mailto:jmoss@codio.com).
