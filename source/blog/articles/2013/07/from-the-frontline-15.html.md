You beauty!!

 - Great looking [CSS3 animation cheat sheet](http://www.justinaguilar.com/animations/index.html).

 - An exhaustive [list of viewport device sizes](http://viewportsizes.com/).

 - [Webflow](http://www.webflow.com/) is released today, which is an extremely impressive site builder, providing a huge level of control, and produces great looking HTML and CSS at the end of it.

 - If you use [Browserify](http://browserify.org/), then you MUST get [Disc](http://hughsk.github.io/disc/) up and running against your code. Freakin' awesome!

 - Addy Osmani discusses whether you should [check in your front-end dependencies](http://addyosmani.com/blog/checking-in-front-end-dependencies/) into source control.
