Goodie, goodie, goodie...

 - The ever popular **[Bower](http://bower.io) just hit 1.0.0 Alpha**. In fact, it released four alphas in the last 24 hours ago! [Here's a summary of what's new](https://github.com/bower/bower/wiki/Rewrite-state) including details of the rewriting efforts.

 - Here's a **fun and useful list of [Github patterns](http://blog.quickpeople.co.uk/2013/07/10/useful-github-patterns/)**.

 - Another great article from [David Walsh](http://davidwalsh.name), this time about **[creating keyboard shortcuts](http://davidwalsh.name/keyboard-shortcuts)** with the open source [Mousetrap](http://craig.is/killing/mice) Javascript library.

 - Instagram are making further steps into the browser by introducing **[Instagram Web Embeds](http://blog.instagram.com/post/55095847329/introducing-instagram-web-embeds)**, which is simply an easy way to embed Instagram photos onto web pages. Kinda' funny that they used images in [their post](http://blog.instagram.com/post/55095847329/introducing-instagram-web-embeds) to demo this.

 - **Media queries are awesome! Media Queries are also easy to forget**. [@Media.info](http://atmedia.info/) helps a little by showing you the media query code for the device you are looking at their site with.

My goal is to publish every week day, so I would appreciate any help. If you find anything that you think would deserve a place in future issues, please [let me know](mailto:jmoss@codio.com).
