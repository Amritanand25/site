 - An [in-depth primer](http://tech.pro/tutorial/1456/a-primer-into-front-end-tooling-gruntjs-for-an-open-source-workflow) into front-end tooling using Grunt, for an open source workflow.

 - [PSD.rb](https://github.com/layervault/psd.rb) is a Ruby library that can parse Photoshop PSD files. The library itself isn't front-end related, but what it does is.

 - [Huxley](https://github.com/facebook/huxley) is a test-like system for catching UI regressions. It watches your browse, takes screenshots, and then tells you when they change. Great idea!

 - Jordan Lewis has written a [post](http://webuild.envato.com/blog/techniques-for-mobile-and-responsive-cross-browser-testing/) about a bunch of techniques for mobile and responsive cross-browser testing at Envato.

 - How did I not know about this one? [Ghostlab](http://vanamco.com/ghostlab/) is a Mac app that provides synchronized testing for web and mobile. Open your app on a couple of devices, then watch each one mimic your actions in the other. Pretty damn cool!
