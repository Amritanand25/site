I know, I know... I didn't do one yesterday. No matter, coz' this one's a good one!

 - Nifty little tool to encourage you to [Embed Responsibly](http://embedresponsively.com/). Enter a Youtube URL or some other embeddable URL, and watch in amazement as it spits out the **HTML5 friendly, embeddable code**.

 - **[Bower](http://bower.io/) hits a final 1.0 release**, so go check out the [changelog](https://github.com/bower/bower/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

 - Moving fast doesn't always work out quite so well, and this [article](http://kenneth.io/blog/2013/07/15/the-messy-state-of-web-notifications-in-chrome-safari-blink-webkit/) about the the **messy state of Web Notifications in Blink and Webkit** demonstrates this.

 - I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/joelmoss/status/359813361749327872) this one yesterday because I was quite excited about it. **[UIKit](http://getuikit.com/) is another Bootstrap style front-end framework**. I know, but hear me out on this one. It's actually pretty good, and very modular. So you can really pick and choose what you want to use. It's pretty comprehensive too.

 - In keeping with the above, InsertHTML posted an **interested [write up](http://www.inserthtml.com/2013/07/bootstraps-and-web-kits-enemy-or-efficient/) on the various front-end frameworks available**. Are they friend or foe?

 - [Plato](https://github.com/jsoverson/plato) is a Node library that will **scan your Javascript source code and provide a bunch of reports that visualize its complexity**. We ran it against the Codio source, and were pleasantly surprised.

 - **Want multiple inheritance in Javascript?** [Ring.js](http://ringjs.neoname.eu/) may just be what you're looking for.

 - Alex Maccaw posted a [succinct article](http://blog.alexmaccaw.com/seo-in-js-web-apps) all about **SEO in Javascript web apps**.

 - And finally... **remember Firebug Lite?** [Gal Steinitz wants to resurrect it](http://gal.steinitz.com/blog/2013/07/19/remember-firebug-lite/).

My goal is to publish every week day, so I would appreciate any help. If you find anything that you think would deserve a place in future issues, please [let me know](mailto:jmoss@codio.com).
