Don't expect #30 tomorrow, as I'll be a little busy watching the Apple event.

- [xhook](https://github.com/jpillora/xhook) is a nifty little JS library to easily modify XHR requests and responses.

- [Favico.js](http://lab.ejci.net/favico.js/) is an even niftier library that allows you to add badges, images and even videos to your site's Favicon.

- Building autocompletion to your app or site? Check out [Sifter](https://github.com/brianreavis/sifter.js), which will help you textually search arrays and hashes of objects by their properties.

- Wanna know more about the upcoming version of Javascript? [This presentation](http://sankhs.com/jschannel-es6) by [sankha93](https://twitter.com/sankha93) all about what's in EcmaScript 6 is a much watch/read.

My goal is to try to publish every week day, so I would appreciate any help. If you find anything that you think would deserve a place in future issues, please [let me know](mailto:jmoss@codio.com).
