Today we shipped some big improvements to the way you view and navigate through Annotations, and also added a handy way to open any tab in full screen.

## Annotations

Annotations are a great way to create interactive, code-based Tutorials and tours. Just create a project and annotate your code using simple comments-based tags. Then viewers of your project will then be able to take a tour of your code, or click around on the annotations that you have created.

Today's release makes Annotations Tour content much less obtrusive. By moving the content out of a dialog window and into a tab - like everything else in Codio - you no longer have to move or resize the dialog out of the way. The code and Annotations content are now shown side-by-side.

[Read the docs](/docs/annotations) for more on Annotations and how to create and use them.

## Full Screen

We've also sneaked in a nice new item to your `View` menu. Just click `Full Screen` and your current tab will be expanded into full screen. Or better still, just hit `F11` on your keyboard for a quick shortcut. And if you don't like `F11`, open up your Preferences from the `Codio > Preferences > User` menu item, and simply override the `fullscreen` option. I set mine to `Cmd-Shift-F`:

```
[ide]
fullscreen = Cmd-Shift-F
```

## And one more thing..

And we've improved the File Tree, by adding arrows to let you expand/collapse directories. Simple change, but it now lets you more easily see what is expanded and what isn't.

Enjoy!
