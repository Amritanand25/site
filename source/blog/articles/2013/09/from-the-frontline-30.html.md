- Now this post on [full-text search using only CSS](http://redotheweb.com/2013/05/15/client-side-full-text-search-in-css.html) is a neat trick, but probably not one you wanna use for real.

- Looking for a responsive navigation for your next site design? Check out [Responsive Nav](http://responsive-nav.com/).

- [breakOn](https://github.com/paulirish/break-on-access) is a nifty little Javascript snippet to add to your Chrome dev tools, that will cause a break upon a given event.

- [grunt newer](https://github.com/tschaub/grunt-newer) is a Grunt task that will only run a task against files that have been modified since the last run.

- [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) gets a new release. [4.3](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/v4.3.0/CHANGELOG.md) includes a bunch of fixes, and updates several of its dependencies.

- [LoDash](http://lodash.com/) also gets a new release, and a major one at that. [Version 2.0](http://kitcambridge.be/blog/custom-builds-in-lo-dash-2-dot-0/) get custom builds, and a few new methods, including `_.curry`.

- Is WebRTC ready yet? Check out [this site](http://iswebrtcreadyyet.com/) which shows a nice table of the latest browser support.

And finally...

- [JSFuck](http://www.jsfuck.com/) is a new language based on Javascript, that uses only six characters to write and execute code. Best name ever!

My goal is to try to publish every week day, so I would appreciate any help. If you find anything that you think would deserve a place in future issues, please [let me know](mailto:jmoss@codio.com).
