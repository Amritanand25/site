Codio is delighted to announce support for Parse.com. Developers can now write code in the world's best Web IDE and deploy it directly to Parse.com.

Javascript/Cloud Code  developers will find that they can code and deploy a Parse app incredibly quickly with nothing but a browser.

##Example Apps
Below are two sample Apps, both of which are standard Parse.com tutorials. You can load them directly into the Codio IDE. Feel free to fork them in Codio (Project->Fork). You can then follow the instructions in the README.md files.

**"To Do"** - a Front-End Only App
This simple "To Do" app is a regular web app that makes calls to the Parse.com platform for data storage. Click on the button to load the IDE.

This can be run and previewed directly from Codio (see README instructions).

**AnyImg** - a Cloud Code Back-End App
This is a simple image sharing app. This gets deployed directly from Codio to Parse.com using a deployment profile.

Code changes can be pushed nearly instantly to Parse.com so it's a real pleasure to work with.
