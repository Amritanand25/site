- [Vinci](http://vinci.io/) is a great looking HTML5 image editor, that runs in the browser.

- Looking for some 21st century dialogs? Check out [Vex](http://github.hubspot.com/vex/docs/welcome/), which is a JS library built by the guys at Hubspot.

- [Fireshell](http://getfireshell.com/) is a boilerplate and workflow tool. Basically a competitor to Yeoman, but seems to be much more streamlined and focused, which I like.

- Fancy running Linux in your browser with nothing but Javascript? [Well why wouldn't you?](http://s-macke.github.io/jor1k/)

- We use RequireJS - a lot! So the [five helpful tips for using RequireJS](http://tech.pro/blog/1561/five-helpful-tips-when-using-requirejs) are good read.

- [The 2nd edition of Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/2nd_edition/) has been announced. So if you're looking for a good Javascript book, go and pledge to this crowd-funded campaign.

- Oh look! Another CSS framework! Ah but it's different... sort of. [ChocolateChip-UI](http://www.chocolatechip-ui.com/) is only for mobile, and is designed to give a native look.

- And it wouldn't be right without mentioning iOS7. [This article](http://mir.aculo.us/2013/09/16/how-to-create-a-web-app-that-looks-like-a-ios7-native-app-part-1/) by Thomas Fuchs, is the first part in a series about how to create a web app that looks like an iOS7 native app.

My goal is to try to publish every week day, so I would appreciate any help. If you find anything that you think would deserve a place in future issues, please [let me know](mailto:jmoss@codio.com).
