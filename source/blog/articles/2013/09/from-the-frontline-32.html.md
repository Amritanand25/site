- Hubspot have released another open source lib called [Pace](http://github.hubspot.com/pace/docs/welcome/), but this time for creating good looking progress indicators for page load and ajax navigation.

- [jq](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/) is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. Slice, filter, map and transform JSON!

- Now this is cool! [BackgroundCheck](http://www.kennethcachia.com/background-check/) is a JS lib for automatically switching the colour of an element, depending upon the brightness of images behind it.

- More awesome effects... [Rainyday](https://github.com/maroslaw/rainyday.js) simulates [raindrops on a window](http://maroslaw.github.io/rainyday.js/demo1.html).

- Flexbox is coming! In fact it's already arrived, and is slower gaining wider browser support. [Solved by Flexbox](http://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/) is a site that demo's what you can do with CSS Flexbox.

- Thanks in no small part to CoffeeScript, [Fat Arrow functions](http://robcee.net/2013/fat-arrow-functions-in-javascript/) are about to make their way in Javascript.
