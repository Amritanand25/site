- HTML5 Rocks have written another one of their expertly written posts, this time on [custom HTML elements](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/customelements/).

- [UIBox](http://www.uibox.in/) is a library of curates HTML, Javascript and CSS components.

- [Perimeter.js](http://github.e-sites.nl/perimeter.js/) is a JS library that will create a invisible perimeter around a target element, and then monitors mouse breaches.

- CSSTricks have written about the [HTML5 Progress element](http://css-tricks.com/html5-progress-element/), and it's another good read.

- [FancySelect](http://code.octopuscreative.com/fancyselect/) is a JS library that will turn your select boxes into a sexy beast!

- The [BatmanJS](http://batmanjs.org/) site just got a facelift.

- Joel Turnbull asks the question: [Does CoffeeScript has a future?](http://gaslight.co/blog/does-coffeescript-have-a-future) Which after reading his post, is a fair question to ask. Simply because Javascript is evolving at a much faster rate than it has in the past. But I still digg Coffeescript!

My goal is to try to publish every week day, so I would appreciate any help. If you find anything that you think would deserve a place in future issues, please [let me know](mailto:jmoss@codio.com).
