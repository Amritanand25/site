- The increasingly popular Javascript framework; [Ember](http://emberjs.com/), has hit a final 1.0.0 release over the weekend. Check out their updated site and docs.

- [SetJS](https://github.com/bebraw/setjs) is a library that provides Python inspired data sets to Javascript.

- This is a [great video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9HGzJIcfDE) of a talk Lea Verou gave all about the humble `border-radius`.

- [Probe](https://github.com/titon/probe) is a neat little library that extends the Javascript native prototypes with Lo-Dash or Underscore methods.

- [CSS Creatures](http://bennettfeely.com/csscreatures/) is a collection of fun animated smiley faces, all written in CSS.

- [AdminJS](http://adminjs.com/) is a backend-agnostic admin framework. Meaning you can boot up an HTML page with this library included, and after defining your models, you have a fully fledged admin backend.

- And just for fun, I give you... [a Javascript Piano!](http://mrcoles.com/piano/)

My goal is to try to publish every week day, so I would appreciate any help. If you find anything that you think would deserve a place in future issues, please [let me know](mailto:jmoss@codio.com).
