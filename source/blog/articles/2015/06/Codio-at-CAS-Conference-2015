*Freddy May to show a complete solution for teaching computer science confidently in the classroom*

‘Teach Computing with Confidence – Comprehensive Teacher Support for the New Curriculum’ will be presented by Freddy May, Co-founder of Codio, developers of the Codio coding and content platform for teaching computer science, at the 2015 CAS Conference at 11:10am on Saturday 20th June at the University of Birmingham. 
Freddy will be addressing the common pain points experienced by both new and experienced teachers of computer science, offering practical guidance on teaching resources mapped to the new computing curriculum, showing how innovative technology can help bring the curriculum alive in new ways, as well as unveiling “Crunch”, a brand new modern day alternative to Little Man Computer.

Freddy will discuss the range of technologies and resources required to comprehensively embrace the new curriculum - both programming and non-programming related.

Freddy will also address: the issues associated with organising school and student groups, how to side step the wasted time and expense of configuring the right technology environment, how built-in auto-marked assessments can be used to track and monitor student progress, and how to provide safe and easy access to resources for students at home.

The talk will demonstrate a range of curriculum-mapped resources - showing how resources brought to life in a cloud Integrated Development Environment and publishing platform can create a unique learning experience.

One key highlight is expected to be a debut showcase of Codio’s new “Crunch” resource, which is a response to teachers’ calls for a more user-friendly, modern day alternative to Little Man Computer.

Crunch is designed to help develop students’ computational and algorithmic thinking skills. It teaches the fetch/execute cycle and comes with a wealth of tutorials, challenges, custom options and a rich instruction set.
