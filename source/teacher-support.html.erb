        Student admin is often a burden – you won’t want a system that doesn’t
        talk to your MIS, and tracking student progress & reviewing code
        shouldn’t tie you in knots.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Codio, we’ve focused on the teacher’s experience & built in comprehensive support.
