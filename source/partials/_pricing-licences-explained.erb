            Our individuals Developer licences are offered on a monthly subscription basis and priced
            in either US dollars or UK pounds. You can set up a recurring monthly payment and manage
            your account and billing details inside Codio.

            If you cancel at any time, your account runs to the end of the last paid licence period at
            which point your account and projects will be de-activated but not deleted. You can export
            or save your projects to a repository — and you can re-activate your account at any time.

            School and university user groups benefit from Codio's organization management tools.

          <p>
            You can create you school or university organization with all your teaching staff, faculty
            members and students assigned to your organization. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Codio offers powerful Class management functionality — allowing you to create Class groups
            comprising teachers, students and any course modules or units you wish to assign to a Class
            — whether these are Codio learning resources or resources or projects you create.
          </p>
          <p>
            We offer easy on-boarding features for education organization user groups, and on licence
            renewal, we'll work with you to manage on-boarding or roll-off of existing students to
            ensure a smooth transition for students starting or ending courses.

            Once auto-marked assessments are live, you'll also see a rich dashboard of information about

            question topic formats.
