          Codio can be used by students of any age and at any knowledge level. Codio is built for
          computer science education and to create an interactive experience for students to learn
          how to code. It can be used with primary school students to university students.

          Codio is designed for computer science teachers to use in the classroom. It combines an
          online code editor, curriculum-mapped courses, course publishing tools and the ability to
          monitor student progress. And because it’s cloud-based, you don’t worry about the
          administrative hassle of setting up a code environment. As a teacher, you get access to
          class administration tools to monitor student progress and manage your class within Codio.
          Students licences get access to the entire Codio platform.

          Usually when you close a project, its' Box will automatically shut down after a few

          be accessed by colleagues or clients.
