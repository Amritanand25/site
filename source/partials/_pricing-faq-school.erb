          Codio can be used by students of any age and at any knowledge level. Codio is built for
          computer science education and to create an interactive experience for students to learn
          how to code. It can be used with primary school students to university students.

          Codio is designed for computer science teachers to use in the classroom. It combines an
          online code editor, curriculum-mapped courses, course publishing tools and the ability to
          monitor student progress. And because it’s cloud-based, you don’t worry about the
          administrative hassle of setting up a code environment. As a teacher, you get access to
          class administration tools to monitor student progress and manage your class within Codio.

          be accessed by colleagues or clients.

          A teacher account gives the teacher access to all the learning and class management
          tools needed, ability to monitor and track student progress and integration capability

          and allow submission of code projects directly to the teacher for assessment.
