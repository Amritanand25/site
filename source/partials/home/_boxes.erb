				<h2>Boxes</h2>
				<p>Each project you create gets its own Box server. When you create a project or open it, it's instantly provisioned. You won't even be aware of it being created or started.</p>
				<p>This is an Ubuntu instance <strong>preinstalled with NodeJS, Ruby, Python, Git, Mercurial and SVN</strong>.</p>
				<p>However, you can easily <strong>add more languages, databases and components</strong>with Codio Box Parts, described below.</p>
