				<h2>Always On Boxes</h2>
				<p>Boxes are stopped and started instantaneously, so Codio stops a box whenever you leave your coding project to help keep resource usage to a sensible level.</p> 
				<p>Coming in March, however, are Always On Boxes. Just flip a switch to ensure your Box and its processes stay running no matter what.</p>
