          Yes. Codio is a web-based front-end IDE that addresses all aspects of the development
          lifecycle—from prototype to deployment. It is easy enough for beginners of all ages to
          learn how to program but also provides functionality to progress with the student. Many
          students can use Codio as they enter professional careers.

          Codio is built for computer science educators, and contains a unique combination of
          technologies that you’ll find hard to match. Codio provides an entire infrastructure
          stack in the cloud to give your students access to their code projects at any time.
          And it offers you great visibility too - with tools that let you monitor progress,
          provide support and feedback. Plus, you can easily create new course content or adapt
          Codio's stacks to create your own learning templates.  As a teacher, you get access
          to class administration tools to monitor student progress and manage your class within
          Codio. Students licences get access to the entire Codio platform.
