      Web-based IDE

    <h2>
      With the power of a desktop equivalent
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Hassle-free and simple to use
    </h3>
    <p>
      Because it’s web-based, there’s nothing to download, install or update.
      But that doesn’t mean Codio’s IDE is less powerful. In fact it has the
      same functionality you would expect to find in a desktop IDE.

          Codio’s education tools made it attractive. Not just to put everyone
          on the same platform, but also as a tool for managing classes. It’s
          given us a way to organise a lot of the technical things we’re doing
          with the kids, and is part of the strategic plan that’s helping us to
          scale.
