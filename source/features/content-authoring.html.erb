      Content authoring tools
    </h1>
    <p>
      Codio's powerful content authoring tool lets you create rich tutorials
      and lesson content directly within the IDE. Content is written using
      simple Markdown, and HTML if required. You can include videos,
      slideshows, sound and other rich media.

        <div class="section-block-copy">
          Each page of your tutorial can control all important aspects of the
          IDE. You can open source code files, terminal windows and HTML
          preview windows. You can also execute commands on the Box. Each
          page is able to select a multi-panel configuration including whether
          the Boxâ€™s file tree is shown. Codio provides a great learning
          experience due to its tight integration between content and the IDE.
