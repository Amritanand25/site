#Ways of using Codio in a Blog or Tutorial
Codio lends itself extremely well to being used to explain code to people. Very often, the best way to accompany a blog or tutorial is to show a real demo or project that people can run and explore.

Codio offers three great ways to do this

- **Show me the code** and **Demo** buttons
- Embed the Codio IDE in your page
- Codio Annotations

##Show me the Code and Demo buttons
This is the simplest way of handling things. You simply want to tell your readers that there is a Demo or some Project Code that accompanies the post.

Codio has a menu option (Project->Embed) that generates the embed code for you so you can copy and paste either markdown (great for Github README.md pages) or HTML.

So, if you would like to see the code that accompanies this post, please click below.

##Embed the Codio IDE
This takes things to the next stage and is really cool. All you need to is create an `<iframe>` and paste the Embed URL from the Embed window into your post.

<iframe width="800" height="500"  src="http://refactor.test.codiodev.com/freddymay/impress/master/tree/index.html"></iframe>

Note that the IDE is fully interactive and no sign up is needed to use it. 

We will soon be introducing two important features to extend this

- Lightweight IDE that loads faster
- Widget that shows only tagged lines of code from a single file. This feature is really cool as you won't need to copy and paste code and if you edit your code in the source project, the changes will show up in your post

##Codio Annotations
Annotations is a great way of documenting your code so people can explore your project and get help as they go. There is also a Guided Tour mode that show people around your project showing them the annotations in a predetermined order.
