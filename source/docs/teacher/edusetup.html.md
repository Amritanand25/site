Getting started with Codio is very easy. Just follow the steps below.

## Student Setup

1. Go to `Organisation Settings` area and create an invitation token.
1. Send the generated link out to all Students who you wish to include in your organisation and they will be automatically added. (If they do not already have a Codio account, they will be taken through the sign up process and then added to your organisation).

1. Once they are logged in, they should press the 'Modules' button in the left hand menu.
1. The 'Recommended' tab should automatically be selected and they can then proceed to a module you advise them to look at.
1. They will see the Module modules in the correct order. They can press 'Start Module' to open it up.
1. They can then follow the Guide instructions and get going.

When students leave the Guide and return to the main Codio dashboard, they will see the projects list. Any opened modules will be visible there, so they they don't have to return to the Modules screen to access them again unless they want to start a new module.


## Additional Teacher Setup
Normally, the first teacher to sign up to Codio should have created an Organization when they signed up. If you're not sure about this please do the following.

1. In the very bottom left of the Codio Dashboard, you will find the Organizations icon ![](/img/docs/education/org-button.png). Click it.
1. If there is no Organization created for your school, you should create one now by pressing the Education button. If there is an organization in the list with the name of your organization there, then you can stop here.
1. Press the 'Create  Organization' button and complete the fields.

Assuming your Organization is now created, other teachers can sign up in the exact same way as the Students. You will be able to add them to your Organization as a teacher as explained in the section below.

## Organization Management
You should make sure that your students and teachers are all added to your Organization in Codio. There are two ways to do this.

### Manually
If you already have students and teachers who have created Codio accounts, you should make sure you add them to your Organization.

- Go to `Organisation Settings` area and create an invitation token.
- Send the generated link out to all who you wish to include in your organisation and they will be automatically added. (If they do not already have a Codio account, they will be taken through the sign up process and then added to your organisation).

Alternatively

- For students, click on 'All Members' and then locate the Student by name or user id.
- For teachers, do the same, but we will shortly be adding a special Teachers team.

### CSV Upload
We will soon be adding the ability to upload your own CSV files to create student accounts and also to create classes. Most schools have MIS systems that allow this data to be easily exported.

In the short term you can email us your CSV file and we will process these for you. Please send this to help@codio.com.

The file should be a CSV file with the following fields present : email (required), full name, user name, class.

Only the email field is required. If your school uses internal user names for students then we advise using this. You can also specify the class that a student belongs to.

## Teacher Support Functionality
In June 2015, we will be releasing a comprehensive set of features that allow teachers to fully manage their student classes and

- access student code
- mark assessment questions within the Modules
- monitor student progress and time spent on modules
- and much more

Below are a couple of screenshots to give you a taste of what is around the corner.
