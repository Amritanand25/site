1. Each projects gets its own, dedicated cloud server, a 'Computer in the Cloud'
1. Install any software you like on it (programming languages, databasesm tools etc.)
1. Absolutely nothing for your school Systems Adminisrator to set up or condigure
1. No security worries at all as everything runs on the Codio platform
1. You get a full blown code editor and IDE
1. You can download all the code you write
1. You can use or configure a [Starter Pack](/docs/teacher/special/packs/) to give your students a Box preconfigured in any way you like (programming languages, databases, starter code, tools etc.). This means there is no setup required and students can immediately start working on any project along with the entire 'Stack' needed for coding projects, databases, tools etc.
