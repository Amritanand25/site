We strongly recommend that teachers are aware of the following special teaching tools and resources that are aimed to promote computational thinking and provide assistance when learning to code.

## Crunch
Crunch is a modern replacement for Little Man Computer. Fully integrated into Codio it is very easy to use and has a more complete instruction set than LMC.

## Flow
Flow is a simple but powerful flowcharting tool integrated right into Codio.
[Click here for details](/docs/teacher/special/flow)

## Boxes
Each Codio project gets its own 'Box', which is a dedicated server that runs in the Cloud. There are no security issues for you or your Network Administrator to worry about and it gives students incredible freedom to build whatever coding projects they like.

## Stacks & Starter Packs
**Stacks** give you the ability to preconfigure any Box configuration you like so students do not have to worry about installing and configuring software, languages, tools etc. before they start coding.
[Click here for details](/docs/teacher/special/stacks)

**Starter Packs** allow you to preconfigure not just the Stack but also any 'starting point code' so your students can start off at whatever point you want them to.

## Tkinter
For teachers wanting to teach UI building with Python (please note that OCR GCSE does not require this) this gives you the tools to build and run Tkinter UIs in the Cloud.
