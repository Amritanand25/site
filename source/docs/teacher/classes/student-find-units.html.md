Students can find modules and units in one of two ways.

## Classes
The best and easiest way for students to access their unit content is via the **Classes** option in the main Codio dashboard. 

Students should

1. Click on the class.
1. Select a module. 
1. Press the **Start Unit** button for the Unit they want to take.

At this point the unit will open up and they can start working.

**Important**: If your students are not seeing the courses/modules you have added to your class and these are Private courses/modules, check that you have set your Organisation as the owner of the course/module when you published the course. See the section on Visibilty [here](/docs/tuts/publish/course-create/) for more on this.


## Courses
Students can also browse the **Courses** from the main Codio dashboard. They can browse modules and units and start a unit from there also even if they have not been added to a class or assigned a module from a class by a teacher.

The advantage of this is that students are free to use any content available on the Codio platform.

If a teacher later creates a class, adds students and assigns a module then Codio will look to see if the students added have already started a unit directly from courses and associate those with the class automatically.
