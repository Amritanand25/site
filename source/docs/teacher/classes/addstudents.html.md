You can add students to your organisation and your class in one easy step by giving each student a unique two-word phrase called a token.  A student will enter the token and will automatically be added to the your organisation and the correct class as they complete the process to create a Codio account.  To do this follow the steps below: 

1. From the **Classes** area, click on your class to open it.

1. Codio will generate a token for you to give to any students you want to join the class.

1. Give your students the token and then ask them to go to [https://codio.com/p/join-class](https://codio.com/p/join-class) or select the 'Join Class' button on our main website. They should enter the token when requested and proceed to register for a Codio account. 
1. To view the students in your class, select the class and the **Students** tab once again. You will see a list of studentsâ€™ names who have successfully completed the sign-up process.
