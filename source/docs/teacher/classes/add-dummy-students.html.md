When you are learning about Codio or testing the student user experience, it is extremely useful to create some test student accounts. 

We strongly recommend that you follow the steps outlined below as a simpler way of doing this as it avoids having to use real email addresses. You will get frustrated if you try to use your personal email addresses and you will soon run out of them and need to create new ones.

### Create a class
All students need to be assigned to a class, so  if you have not already got a class ready, you should first create a test class to experiment with. 

[Click here](/docs/teacher/classes/) for information on creating a class.
[Click here](/docs/teacher/classes/addstudents/) for information on how to add a student to a class.

When adding new students you must make sure you are first signed out of any Codio account. Even if Codio is not currently open, the cookie information will be stored in your browser so if you have previously been logged in you should first go to codio.com and then sign out before you add a new student using the class invite url.

### The '+' in an email address
When creating a new student account, the trick is to take advantage of the `+` symbol used within your proper email address, so something like `johndoe+1@myorg.com` or `johndoe+student1@myorg.com`.

This trick is not Codio specific and will work for account signups for most platforms unless they specifically block it. What happens is that the platform sees `johndoe+1@myorg.com` as a unique email address. However, when emails are sent in this format from any platform they will be received by `johndoe@myorg.com`.

The advantage is therefore that you do not need to create or use any special email accounts to create test student accounts. All you need to do is to remember the email address you used.

### Passwords for test students
To make life as easy as possible, we recommend that you choose a single password that is used for all test student accounts. These can then be used by you and colleagues during testing.

### Accessing student accounts in parallel to your teacher account
When you start testing, you will often want to be signed on both as a teacher and a student. Codio will not allow you to be logged into two accounts simultaneously. To get around this you should access your student account
