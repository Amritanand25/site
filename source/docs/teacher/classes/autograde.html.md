This option instructs Codio to automatically take the auto-graded assessments score and transfer it to the main grade field once the unit is marked as complete by the teacher or student.

The main purpose of this feature is to ensure that lecturers do not have to manually transfer the score into the grading field so that when grades are released to an LMS platform, if you are using one, the score is transferred without any manual intervention.
