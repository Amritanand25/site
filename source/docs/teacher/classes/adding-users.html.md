## Owners
The only users who can create classes are organization owners. Being an owner does not make you a teacher of the class and you should add yourself as a teacher as described below.

Owners are the only users who are able to delete classes.

## Adding teachers
If you are the teacher of the class, you should always add yourself as a teacher, even if you are the organization owner. You can also add others as teachers to the class. 

Teachers are able to view student projects from the student listing within the class. They can also assign modules.

1. Go to your class.
1. Click on the **Teachers** tab at the top of the listing.
1. Click the **Edit Teachers** slider so the search field appear to its left.
1. This list will show all Codio users within your organization so be sure to select the right person. You can type in the field to search or you can scroll through the list. Once you have found the right person, click on that person or press enter with the correct name highlighted.

The teacher is now added to the list of teachers.
