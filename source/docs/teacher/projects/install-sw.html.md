## Installing Software

> **IMPORTANT NOTICE**
>
> We have now released a new generation of Codio Boxes that provide many improved capabilities. These new ‘G2’ Boxes provide full sudo (root) access.
Our second generation projects and stacks are identified with a G2 label. We will be gradually updating all our Certified Stacks, Packs and Units to use the G2 platform.

Please refer to the [Installing software packages](/docs/ide/boxes/installsw/box-parts) section for details on how to install many other languages, database, web servers and other system components.
