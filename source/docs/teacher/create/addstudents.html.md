### Adding a student to the organization only
If you want to add students to the organization just to allow them to create coding projects then you should create a dummy class and follow the steps described below. 

### Adding a student to a class

You can add students to your organisation and your class in one easy step by giving each student a unique two-word phrase called a token.  A student will create a Codio account, enter the token and will automatically be added to the your organisation and the correct class.  To do this follow the steps below: 

1. From the **My Classroom** area, click on your class to open it.

1. Click on the **blue plus** sign, top left of the page.

1. Codio will generate a token for you to give to any students you want to join the class.

1. Give your students the token and then ask them to log in to Codio. They should enter the token when requested, or go to the 'Join a Class' area where they can enter the token. 
1. To view the students in your class, select the class and the **Students** tab once again. You will see a list of studentsâ€™ names who have successfully completed the sign-up process.

Alternatively, you can give them the invite URL. If they are not already Codio users they will be directed to sign up for a new Codio account (as a student) and automatically added into your organisation and the class. If they are already Codio users, when they log into their account with this URL, they will also be added into the organisation and class.
