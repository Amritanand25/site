You can add students to your organization in two ways

1. Add them to the Organization only.
1. Add them to a Class, which will also add them to the Organization.

### Adding a student to the organization only
An administrator user should click on their user name from the dashboard and then select the Organization shown towards the bottom of the page. Next, select Organization Settings and scroll down until you find the "Invitation Token" section. 

Copy the Invite URL field and send this to the student via email or place the token in a web page. When accessed, the student will be taken through a signup process and and as they select that they are a Student will be added to the organization automatically. If the student already has a Codio account then organisation assignment will be made.

### Adding a student to a class

You can add students to your organisation and your class in one easy step by giving each student a unique two-word phrase called a token.  A student will enter the token and will automatically be added to the your organisation and the correct class as they complete the process to create a Codio account.  To do this follow the steps below: 

1. From the **Classes** area, click on your class to open it.

1. Codio will generate a token for you to give to any students you want to join the class.

1. Give your students the token and then ask them to go to [https://codio.com/p/join-class](https://codio.com/p/join-class) or select the 'Join Class' button on our main website. They should enter the token when requested and proceed to register for a Codio account. 
1. To view the students in your class, select the class and the **Students** tab once again. You will see a list of studentsâ€™ names who have successfully completed the sign-up process.
