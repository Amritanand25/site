Codio supports full integration with any Learning Management System that supports the LTI interface such as Moodle, Blackboard, Canvas and many others.

### Authentication and account creation
Once you have configured the LTI/LMS settings, your LMS manages all aspects of signing in to Codio as well as account creation. All your teachers and students need is an LMS account.

If an LMS user has never used Codio before then an account will automatically be created when they access their first Codio course materials.

If an LMS user already has a Codio account then **provided the email address of their Codio account matches the email address of their LMS account** the same Codio account will be used. If, however, the user has used a different email address within Codio, then a new Codio account will be created that matches that of the LMS account.

## Setup, configuration and usage
The following instructions on are provided as short videos.

### One time setup of LMS/LTI
