You need to create an ‘organization’ to use Codio as an educational organization. This allows you to access Codio’s curriculum content and classroom features.

To create an organization follow these steps:

1. Go to www.codio.com and select the **[Free Trial](https://codio.com/start-edu-trial)** button

1. Complete the form with your details, then click **Sign Up**
  To speed up the verification process and allow you to start the trial we would recommend that you use your institution email address and a name of the organisation reflective of your institution

1. Your organization (school, university or other educational organization) has now been set up.
