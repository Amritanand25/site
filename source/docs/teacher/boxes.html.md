Each Codio Project comes with its own Ubuntu server (Box). You can think of this as a computer in the Cloud. There a number of features you should be aware of that will really help teachers and students ...

- There is nothing for your network administrator to worry about from a security perpsective as each Box runs on the Codio servers, not your school's.
- There is nothing to configure for you or your network administer. 
- You can use or configure a [Starter Pack](/docs/quickstart/packs/) to give your students a Box preconfigured in any way you like. This means there is no setup required and students can immediately start working on any project along with the entire 'Stack' needed for coding projects, databases, tools etc.
- Being browser based, teachers and students can access their projects from the classroom and from home.
 
Once you are in the IDE, you can open up a terminal window and access your Box from the command line.

You do not have, and do not need, sudo access. Almost all common commands are available without needing the sudo prefix. Furthermore, you can rapidly install your own languages, components, databases etc. from the [Install software](/docs/ide/boxes/installsw/) menu.

As you will see in the next sections, you can configure and even pre-configure your Boxes with everything from [Stacks](/docs/quickstart/stacks/) and [Starter Packs](/docs/quickstart/packs/) to [Modules](/docs/quickstart/modules/).

If you create your own Course Units, you can automate things still further by setting your templated Box up and then assigning it to a Unit within a Module. You can then assign your Module to your class so when they start a Unit they have are automatically presented with the correct starting point.
