Each Codio Project comes with its own Ubuntu server (Box). Once you are in the IDE, you can open up a terminal window and access your Box from the command line.

You do not have, and do not need, sudo access. Almost all common commands are available without needing the sudo prefix. Furthermore, you can rapidly install your own languages, components, databases etc. from the [Install software](/docs/ide/boxes/installsw/) menu.

As you will see in the next sections, you can configure and even pre-configure your Boxes with everything from [Stacks](/docs/quickstart/stacks/) and [Starter Packs](/docs/quickstart/packs/) to [Modules](/docs/quickstart/modules/).
