## Creating and editing a new Flow file
To create a new flow chart, simply create a new file with the extension `.flow`. A new Flow window will appear and you can start creating and editing your file.

A new file is created from either the File menu or by right-clicking on the project name line in the file tree.

To edit an existing `.flow` file, simply click on the file name to open the Flow editor.


## Adding an element
To add a new Flow element, simply click on one the the 3 element buttons at the top of the page and drag it into the chart area.

## Resizing
You can resize any element by first clicking on it and then dragging the handles.

## Selecting multiple elements
You can select multiple elements in one of the following ways

- by pressing the shift key then clicking and dragging the mouse around the elements you want to select.
- by pressing the Shift or Ctrl/Cmd and then individually clicking on the elements you want to select.

Selected elements can then be dragged to a new position.

## Connecting with lines
You can connect elements together with a line. If you move your mouse over an element, you will see the places where you can connect a line. These appear as small 'x' symbols.

Click and drag in one of these locations and move your mouse to a connect location on another element. When you release the mouse the line will be drawn.

## Moving and adjusting lines
You can move a connecting line by first selecting the line, the dragging the connecting point to another connection location.

You can also adjust the curvature of the line by dragging one of the drag handles on the line.

Lines can be deleted using the delete or backspace keys once the line is selected.

## Adding and moving text on lines
To add some text to a line by double-clicking the line. Start typing and you will see the text appear.

Once you have added text you can move the text area by clicking on it (it should not be in edit mode) then dragging it to a new location.

## Panning, scrolling & zooming
Your flow chart can be much bigger than the available screen size. You can pan around your flow chart by dragging the background.

If you are looking to multi-select rather than pan, you just need to press the shift key before dragging.

You can zoom in and out using the '+' and '-' buttons. In the top right is a mini-map of your flowchart and you can drag the blue square around to pan quickly around the entire chart.

## Copying
You can copy an existing chart element by

- selecting the element, then clicking and dragging on the '+' symbol that appears.
- using copy and paste keyboard shortcuts
