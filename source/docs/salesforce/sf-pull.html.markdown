You can retrieve your files from SalesForce in two ways

- Pull all : this option can be found in the Tools->SalesForce menu. In Phase I, we do not perform any difference analysis and we simply overwrite any local files that may have changed. We will be implementing a difference analysis which will allow options to select what gets overwritten.
- Pull file : if you have a file that you want to overwrite by pulling from SalesForce, then right-click and select the Pull File option.

If you want to test this, just make a change to a file directly within SalesForce and then Pull. You do not even need to close the file in Codio and as soon as the Pull is completed you will see a live update of the file with the new data.
