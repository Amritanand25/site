Codio maintains an ongoing error log as a file in the root of your project. You can click on it at any time to inspect the result of communications between Codio and SalesForce servers.

As with any other Codio files, this log file is a real-time file that can be seen by all users. It can also be edited.


##Clearing the log
As the log is a normal Codio file, you can delete the log as follows

- Tools->Salesforce->Clear Log menu item
- Remove the file by right-clicking it; it will get recreated by Codio automatically
- Ctrl/Cmd+A then press delete; you can even manually delete selected parts of the log
