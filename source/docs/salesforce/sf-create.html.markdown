Getting started is done as with any other Codio project, from the Console. Select the 'Create Project' option and you'll see the following screen.

##SalesForce security token
You get this from SalesForce itself. Developer Salesforce users will be able to generate or reset their security token. Changing your password will require you to request a new security token.

##Ready to go
Once the project is created, click on it to load open the IDE. At project creation time, Codio does not retrieve data from SalesForce. You need to do a 'Pull All' manually as [described here](/docs/salesforce/sf-pull).
