Getting started is done as with any other Codio project, from the Console. Select the 'Create Project' option and then select the dialog.

Make sure you select the SalesForce option from the dropdown. You will then see the SalesForce specific fields appear.

##SalesForce security token
You get this from SalesForce itself. You will need the developer edition of SalesForce do use this feature.

##Ready to go
Once the project is created, click on it to load open the IDE. At project creation time, Codio does not retrieve data from SalesForce. You need to do a 'Pull All' manually as [described here](/docs/salesforce/sf-pull).
