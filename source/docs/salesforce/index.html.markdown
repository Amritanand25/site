Our support for Salesforce.com focuses on speeding up the coding process, which is where a very significant amount of time is spent when developing Salesforce apps.

The functioanlity is pretty new, so expect to find some issues and if you do, please report them to the forum http://forum.codio.com.


Depending on the level of community engagement, we'll consider extending Codio with more and more SalesForce specific features over time. However, for the time being you should consider Codio as being a useful coding tool with a few interesting capabilities and advantages.

- it is extremely fast
- it is a pure web app, so you can use any modern browser and there's nothing to install
- you get all the productivity features Codio has for HTML5, CSS and JS development
- Git integration
- Real-time collaborative coding like you get in Google Docs, although this is still in its infancy
- Fantastic support for HTML5 coding
- Code from anywhere, any browser
- No setup or installation required
