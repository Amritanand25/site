We have started adding support for SalesForce.com to the Codio IDE. We make no claims about it being the best thing you can use for SalesForce.com development (yet), but the Codio IDE has a lot going for it and if the SalesForce community engages with us, we'll extend it with more and more SalesForce specific features.

You'll get some of these benefits

- it is extremely fast
- it is pure HTML5, so you can use any modern browser and there's nothing to install
- you get all the productivity features Codio has for HTML5, CSS and JS development
- Git integration
- Real-time collaborative coding like you get in Google Docs
- Fantastic support for HTML5 coding
- Code from anywhere, any browser
- No setup or installation required

##Enhancements
The following sections in this chapter explain the current functionality. What we now need is some input and feedback from the SalesForce.com community. 

The way you should send in enhancement requests is to use our integrated messaging system. You can start and track a conversation with us from the Help->Support/Contact Us menu item.
