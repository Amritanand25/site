We have started adding support for SalesForce.com to the Codio IDE. We make no claims about it being the best thing you can use for SalesForce.com development (yet), but the Codio IDE has a lot going for it and if the SalesForce community engages with us, we'll extend it.

You'll get some of these benefits

- it is extremely fast
- you get all the productivity features Codio has for HTML5, CSS and JS development
- Git integration
- Real-time collaborative coding like you get in Google Docs
- Fantastic support for HTML5 coding
- Code from anywhere, any browser
- No setup or installation required

##Enhancements
What we have done so far is solid but we can do pretty well anything to extend this now. All we need is input and guidance from SalesForce users.

The way you should send in enhancement requests is to use our integrated messaging system. You can start and track a conversation with us by pressing the icon in the Codio IDE (see screenshot below).
