You can push your Codio files to SalesForce in two ways

- **Push all** : this option can be found in the `Tools > SalesForce` menu. In our Phase I, we do not perform any difference analysis and we simply overwrite any local files that may have changed. We will be implementing a difference analysis which will allow options to select files to push.
- **Push file** : if you have a file that you want to overwrite in SalesForce by pushing to it, then right-click in the file tree and select the Push File option.

If you want to test this, just make a change to a file in Codio, then look at the matching file in SalesForce. Now perform the push operation and check in SalesForce.
