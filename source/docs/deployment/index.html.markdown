Codio lets you deploy all or any part of your project with a single click to a custom 'deployment target'. Currently, we support deployment to the Codio platform (which will require a paid plan once we are out of beta) or to an FTP server.

We will also be adding the following target types shortly:

- SFTP
- Parse.com
- Nodejitsu
- Heroku
- more by popular request
