You not to need to deploy when you are developing your project. Front-end code is automatically served up over Port 80. Access to back-end code (PHP, Ruby etc.) is done by accessing your [Box](/docs/boxes/ext-access/).

Codio lets you deploy all or any part of your project with a single click to a custom 'deployment target'. Currently, we support deployment to the following platforms.

- [FTP](/docs/deployment/type-ftp/)
- [SFTP](/docs/deployment/type-sftp/)
- [RSYNC](/docs/deployment/type-rsync/)
- [Nodejitsu](/docs/deployment/type-nj/)
- [Parse.com](/docs/deployment/type-parse/)
- [Generic Git deployment](/docs/deployment/type-git/)
