There are two menu locations for deploying your projects. 

##Tools->Deployment->Deploy
This let's you deploy to any of your deployment targets. You are shown a log if any errors occur. 

![deploy screen]()

##Preview (& Deploy)
[Described here](), this offers deployment in combination with a preview immediately afterwards, all with a single click. It is recommended to use this method most of the time as at involves less actions.

![preview button]()

##Base Path
When using remote servers, you should make sure that you have [set your base path correctly](/docs/deployment/basepath) so Preview knows where to locate your files on the remotes.

If you encounter any errors when using Deploy & Preview, you should try the Tools->Deployment->Deploy option as this gives you a full error log.
