When you want to deploy, press the "Deploy" menu item in the top bar. Your deployment options will be displayed in the currently active [Panel](/docs/panels).

You can just press the Deploy Now button or you can select another target from the dropdown list first.

Once the deployment has been successfully executed, you will see the URL required to access the application/site. This URL is also stored and shown both here and in the main Deployment Targets screen.
