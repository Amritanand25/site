Codio can be used without [creating an account](/docs/signup). If you are not signed in, it operates in anonymous mode, in which case you can still create and edit single projects but there are lots of features you can't access. 

Signing up is completely free and gives you access to 99% of the available Codio functionality. Any public project you create is free.

[Click here](/docs/anon/index.html) to read more about managing anonymous projects.
