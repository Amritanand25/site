Codio is very usable without even [creating an account](/docs/signup). It operates in an anonymous mode, in which case you can still create and edit single projects but there is no console, which let's you organize your projects as well as some other nice features.

[Click here](/docs/anon/index.html) to read more about managing anonymous projects.
