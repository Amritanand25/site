We strongly recommend you take advantage of this feature. Chapters serve two purposes ...

1. They break the content down visually in the section list (table of contents)
1. They allow to students to reset their content to its original state if they have mangled the code through experimentation and want to restore it.

## Seeing Chapters
You can see which Chapters are defined by opening up the table of contents. You can see that each Chapter is bold and sections within each Chapter are numbered accordingly.

## Defining Chapters
To define a chapter, you should first select a page in the editor. Next, press the Settings buttons. The Page tab should already be selected.

To set this page as the start of a new chapter, enable the 'Set section as chapter' slider.

## Reset Chapter
The Reset Chapter feature is a great way for students to reset any chapter to its initial state after hacking sample code around. Students can reset the chapter from the menu as shown below.

You can specify which folder or folders should be restored when the student selects this option. All folders specified within the Reset List field are then restored from the master copy of the Unit.

Currently, it is not possible for the author to use this feature as it only works when it is used by a Student within a Class. For an author to test from the viewpoint of a student, you will need to

1. Create a Unit within a Module. If the Unit already exists, locate the Unit within a Module and enable the Edit Units slider. You should then click on Refresh Source.
1. Click on the Unit you want to test. You can then select the button 'Test Unit' which will create a copy that you can run with the same access privileges as a student would see, including the ability to reset chapters.
