To create a new Course or Module, press the New button in the top right of the screen. You should then complete the fields.

![Modules Create](/img/docs/course_create.png)

## Name, Descriptions, Image & Tags
You are required to enter a name for your Course/Module. The Short Description is optional but please add something so others can easily identify it.

A Long Description is usually a good idea and helps other users understand the scope of your Course/Module.

You should also add tags that identify the technologies used. An image is also suggested.

## Visibility
This determines whether your Course and its constituent Modules are publicly available to all Codio users or should remain private to you and/or your [Organization](/docs/dashboard/organizations/) (if you are a member of an Organization). Private Courses require a paid subscription.

To publish your Course/Module to an Organization, please read on.

## Owner
By default, you are the owner of the Course you create. If you select an Organization from the 'Who should own this course' dropdown, then 

1. Any Owner group members of that Organization are able to adminster the Course/Module.
2. All Organization members will be able to see it in the listing, even if the Course is marked as private. Students can find these Courses/Modules in the 'Shared' tab within the main listing.

To create a Course/Module that is private to your Organization, select the Private option and select the Organization as the owner.
