When you create a Course or Module in Codio, it is private to yourself or to your organization as described in [Create a Course or Module]()

However, if you set your Course/Module as 'Public' it becomes available for any other Codio user to find in the All tab of the listings.

You can make a Course public at Course/Module creation or by pressing the `Edit` button having selected the Course/Module from the listing.
