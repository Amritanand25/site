When you create a course in Codio, it can be kept private to yourself or to your organization, if you have a paid subscription. 

However, if you are happy to have your course public then it becomes available for any other Codio user to find, use,  copy and modify the Units in the Modules of the course.

You can make a Course public at Course creation or by pressing the `Edit` button having selected the Course from the listing.

##How to Use and Modify a public Course

- Locate and select the Course you are interested in
- From the Courses list click on the Module you want to access.
- From the Modules Unit list click on the 'Start Unit' icon for the unit you want to modify
- This will now fork that Unit into a new Project in your Codio account. From this point, you are free to make whatever changes you require to the code or to the [Codio Guide](/docs/ide/tools/guides/).

If there is an author attribution in the Guide or the readme.md file, please be respectful and leave the attribution in place.

##Important
When you assign a Codio course to the public domain, you should be prepared for the course module units to be used and modified freely and without restriction.
