When you create a Course or Module in Codio, it is private so is visible to you only.

However, if you set your Course/Module as 'Public' it becomes available for any other Codio user to find in the All tab of the listings.

You can make a Course/Module public at Course/Module creation or by pressing the `Edit` button having selected the Course/Module from the listing.

To publish a Course/Module only to your organization, please refer to [Creating a Course or Module](/docs/tuts/publish/course-create/)
