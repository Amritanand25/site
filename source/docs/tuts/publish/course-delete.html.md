You can delete a Course/Module by selecting the item from the listing, then pressing the `Delete` button. 

Deleting a Course does not delete its Modules. Similarly, deleting a Module does not delete the Projects that its Modules contained. However, all Unit definitions will be deleted and would need to be recreated.

If you delete a Course/Module, any Course, Modules and Units that have already been assigned to a Class will remain intact for the lifetime of that class.
