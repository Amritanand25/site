## Adding a Course
You can add a Course from the main Course listing screen by pressing the New Course button at the top right of the screen.

## Adding a Module
Any user can create their own Modules by pressing the New Module button in the top right of the Modules screen. 

However, if you want to add a Module to a Course owned by someone else then

1. At the Organization level, you need to be an Owner within that Organization.

Having selected the Course, you will be shown a list of Modules. Enable the 'Edit Modules' toggle button and then press the `Add Module` button to add a new module.

## Adding a Unit
Please read the next section [Adding a Unit]() for details.

## Searching for Modules
The Module browser will open for you to search for the module(s) you wish to add. 

You can filter from the available options in the tabs, or search by simply typing into the search field, whereupon Codio will search within all Module names, descriptions and owner fields and filter your list accordingly.

You can also order the list of modules by name or owner and use the 'Filter by Course' drop down to view modules in other courses.
