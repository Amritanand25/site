The Codio Lexikon is an integrated help system that lets users lookup information quickly and easily as new topics are learned without having to trawl the web.

The Lexikon is organized into Topics. We currently have added Javascript, HTML, CSS, Python, Linux and Crunch. However, we can easily add coverage for any other Topic. If you are interested in additional topics, please email support@codio.com.

## Using the Lexikon with Guides
To make accessing the Lexikon from your Guides content even easier, we have a [Global Option in the Guides settings](/docs/tuts/author/lexikon) that lets you specify the default topic to select. If you use this option, an icon will appear in the Guide toolbar that will load the Lexikon window with the selected topic automatically selected.
