Organizations allow you to do the following things currently 

- organize Codio users into Teams
- centralized billing, allowing one user to pay for others

This is useful but not great. However, we will soon be adding a number of other useful features that enhance its value

- permissions for other users and teams to have owner level access to projects and boxes
- Always On Boxes can be purchased and shared across an Organization
- Bigger Boxes (more RAM and CPU) can be purchased and shared across an Organization
