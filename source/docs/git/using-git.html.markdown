Codio offers both a command line interface as well as a few menu commands.

##Command Line
The command line is accessed from the `Tools > Git > Command Line` menu item.

All Git commands can be invoked from the command line. You can also use the up arrow to retrieve recent commands.

Unlike a terminal window, each git command will clear the window and output will be shown immediately below the command line. If users want a more traditional terminal window, then please let us know.

##Menu Options
We currently offer a few menu options under `Tools > Git` to make your life a bit easier. We recommend that you get used to using the Command Line as this is usually faster.
