A class is a collection of students. A class is also assigned a course. Once you have defined a class, you are ready to assign modules to students.

##Student vs. Teacher views
Both teachers and students are able to access the classes list but the information you see will be different depending on whether you are a student or a teacher.

##Class Listings
The main classes screen shows a complete listing of all classes belonging to any  organizations you are a member of.

SCREENSHOT OF CLASSES

You can search the classes listing as well as order the available columns. 

SCREENSHOT MODULES

When you select a class, you are immediately shown the course that has been assigned to that class as well as the complete list of modules that make up that course.

SCREENSHOT STUDENTS

You can then select a module and you will see a list of all students who are in the class.

From the list of students for the module, you are also able to access an individual student's code project by clicking the icon in the right most column of the student entry.
