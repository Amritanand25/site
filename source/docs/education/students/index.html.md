If you are a student looking to use Codio courses then there are two main features Codio offers.

##Classes
If you are part of an educational organization then you will find that your teacher has assigned courses and modules to you. 

SCREENSHOT

Click on the Classes menu item beneath the Education menu item in the left pane in your Codio dashboard. This will show you a list of classes to which you have been assigned by a teacher. Select a class and you will see all the modules that are in the course that your class is taking. 

Even though you can seen all modules available for the course, you can only access the modules that have been specifically assigned by your teacher at that point in time. Assigned modules can be identified by the appearance if the 'Open in IDE' icon in the right most column.

When you see this icon, you can click on it and your project assignment will be loaded. You will be shown instructions on how to proceed within the project itself.

###Getting back to the Dashboard
To return to your dashboard, click on your user name in the top right of the screen or use the Project->Exit menu item.


##Public Courses
If others have create public courses, then you are able to find and use these.

From the main Codio dashboard, select the Education menu item on the left pane. Beneath this you will then see a 'Courses' menu item. Click on this to see all available courses. You can use the search box to search for project names or text in the description fields.

We will be soon be providing additional categorization options so that content authors can assign their courses to categories such as Programming Language, Skill Level, Content Type. 

When you find a course that you want to try out, you should click on it and then click on any of the modules within the course. This will open up the module as a normal Codio project.
