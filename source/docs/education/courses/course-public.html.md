Codio is proud to have a major Education initiative underway that promotes the teaching of coding globally with open source at its heart.

When you create a course in Codio, it can be kept private to yourself or your organization if you have a paid subscription. However, if you are happy to have your course public then it becomes available for anyone else in the world to use to teach with.

To enable your course to be available publicly, you should press the 'Edit' button at the top of the course screen. Then, select the **Public** radio button in the Visibility section.

##The Codio Open Source License
When you assign a Codio course to the public domain, a license file `license.txt` will automatically be inserted into the project that can be summarized as follows

- lets others use, remix, tweak, and build upon your work even for commercial purposes
- derivative works must use the same license
