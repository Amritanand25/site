A module is an individual course item. You can add as many modules as you like into a course. 

Press the 'Add' button to add a new module to your course.

SCREENSHOT

You can then choose the source of your new module. The source can be any of the following options

- **Codio** : your project source is a Codio project. You should specify the project in the following format `Codio-Username/projectname` as appears in the url your project when opened in the Codio IDE.
- **Git** : a Git repo URL. If using BitHub or BitBucket, this will be the HTTPS url.
- **Mercurial** : it is recommended you do not use this option.
- **ZIP** : a zip file that you will be prompted to upload.

##What happens next?
Once you have chosen a source for your module, a snapshot is made and is stored in a separate location. You do not need to worry about this as it is managed by Codio. 

If you now update your source project, it will **NOT** be reflected in the course module. If you make further canges and wish to update the snapshot, then you should FRIEDEL????
