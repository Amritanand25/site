##Paid usage
If you want to use Codio to teach classes of students then you will need an organization account. Codio offers significant discounts on organization accounts for not-for-profit educational institutions.

##Owners and Class creation rights

##All Members team
If you want to see a complete list of all people within your organization then you should select the Teams menu item and then click on the All Members team.
