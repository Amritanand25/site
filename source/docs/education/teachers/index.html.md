This section need only be read by teachers. It covers the key concepts of configuring and managing [courses, modules](/docs/education/teachers/courses) and [classes](/docs/education/teachers/classes).

##Courses & Modules
You will want to create a Course that covers your subject matter and then create individual modules, each of which covers a specific and manageable chunk of material that you wish to teach.

A module is just a Codio project that will usually contains some code and a [Codio Guide](/docs/guides). So first of all, get comfortable using Codio for normal projects.

Any Codio user can create their own course and also assign permissions to other users to administer that course.

##Guides
A [Codio Guide](/docs/guides) is a rich content creation tool that allows you to author your coding course materials. Guides are authored within Codio and are very easy to write using simple markdown. 

##Teachers
A teacher is a Codio user that has administrative rights over a course. The Codio user that creates a course will automatically be considered a teacher for that course. Teachers can create modules for a course and also manage classes of students.

##Students
Any Codio user who is assigned to a class is considered a Student.

##Classes
A class is a collection of students. A course teacher is able to add students to a class.
