This section need only be read by teachers. It covers the key concepts of configuring and managing [courses, modules](courses) and [classes](classes).

##Courses & Modules
You will want to create a Course that covers your subject matter and then create individual modules, each of which covers a specific and manageable chunk of material that you wish to teach.

A module is a Codio project that will usually contain some template code and a guide. It does not make much sense to progress until you are familiar with using Codio for normal projects.

Any Codio user can create their own course and can then assign other users as teachers to that course.

##Guides
A Codio guide is a rich content creation tool that allows you to author your coding course materials. Guides are authored within Codio and are very easy to write using simple markdown. 

Guides are based on the existing Annotations concepts and will replace Annotations completely. Any Annotations content you create will need to be modified in order to run as a Guide. Guides should be available by September 1st, 2014.

##Teachers
A teacher is a Codio user that has administrative rights over a course. The Codio user that creates a course will automatically be considered a teacher for that course. Teachers can create modules for a course and also manage classes of students.

##Students
Any Codio who is assigned to a class is considered a Student.

##Classes
A class is a collection of students. A course teacher is able to add students to a class.
