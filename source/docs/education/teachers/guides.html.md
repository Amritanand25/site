A Guide is a way of providing tutorial content to the student. Codio Guides will allow you to write rich, multi-page content using simple markdown.

The general idea is that the student sees the content in one Codio IDE pane and can navigate between instruction steps. Meanwhile, another pane(s) is used to write your code.

The image below shows this happening using Codio Annotation (described below). Codio Guides does much the same but better!

Codio Guides is currently under development and will be available by September 15th, 2014. In the meantime, there are two very good ways that you can author your content

##Codio Annotations
This existing Codio feature allows a very similar approach to that we will offer with Guides although it is not quite as full featured. We will be discontinuing Annotations once we release Guides, so we suggest not investing too much effort. 

The good news is that you will be able to copy and paste your content into Codio Guides. There will not be a converter.

[Read about Codio Annotations](/docs/annotations).

##README.md
Creating a `README.md` file is a good approach for very simple tutorials. You create it using markdown and it will automatically appear when the project loads for the first time. This is not a good strategy for providing high quality tutorials of any length.
