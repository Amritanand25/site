Codio is proud to have a major Education initiative underway that promotes the teaching of coding globally with open source content at its heart.

When you create a course in Codio, it can be kept private to yourself or to your organization, if you have a paid subscription. However, if you are happy to have your course public then it becomes available for anyone else in the world to use. Public courses can be freely used, copied and modified.

To enable your course to be publicly available, you should press the 'Edit' button at the top of the course screen. Then, select the **Public** radio button in the Visibility section.

##Important
When you assign a Codio course to the public domain, you should be prepared for this course to be used and modified freely and without restriction.
