When you create a course, ownership and course administrative rights are assigned to your Codio user name by default. However, you may wish to assign admins permissions to other users (teachers) later.

To do this, you should select your course and press the 'Edit' button in the top course section. You can then press the 'Permissions' button to add or remove admin users. Start typing the user's full name or Codio user name and matches will appear automatically below.

Once you have added users, they will appear below the search field
