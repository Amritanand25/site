It can happen that after you create your course you make some changes to the original course by modifying the source Codio projects. If this happens, you will not see these changes reflected in the class modules.

The complete steps to update your course are as follows :

- modify your Codio source project
- select the 'Education->Publish' menu item to update the course itself
- from the class screen, press the 'Update Course' button to pull in these updates

You should be aware that we currently disable this button if any modules have been assigned to a class. The only way around this is to delete the class and recreate it. We hope to improve this soon so that unassigned modules can still be updated.
