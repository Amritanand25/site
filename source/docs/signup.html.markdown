Creating an Account is simple. From the [Codio.com](https://codio.com) website, click on the Sign Up option in the top sitebar.

You will then be shown the signup dialog.

Once your account is created it will be available as `https://codio.com/username`. Anyone is able to access this URL to see your Dashboard, where they will be shown information about you and any public projects you have created.

If you sign up with GitHub, we recommend you set a Codio password at this point, as you will be prompted to enter the first time you preview private projects. 

You can enter or change your password from the Codio->Account menu item.
