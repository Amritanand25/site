You can build your own Bower component by adding it to a Git repo. Bower pulls its components from Git and Codio lets you specify your own Git urls for Bower components.

There are several resources out there that describe how to set it all up

[NetTuts](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-and-tips/meet-bower-a-package-manager-for-the-web/) has a really good tutorial. Skip down to the **Building Packages** and **Configuring Bower** sections.

And then there is the main [Bower.io](http://bower.io) site of course.
