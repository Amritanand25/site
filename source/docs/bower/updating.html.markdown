Let's say Jquery release a new version and you want to update your project, too. Simply go to the Installed Components tab and press the refresh button next to your component. Codio will ask Bower to fetch the latest version and that's it. 

Bower knows what updates can be performed safely, as the component owner includes this information in the bower.json file.
