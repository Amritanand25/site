This explains the key things you should know in order to get the most out of the Codio IDE in as short a time as possible.

##1. Signup
Signing up is effortless and gives you access to the complete set of features. Any public projects you create are (and will always be) free.

Signup from the signup link at the top of the page at [Codio.com](http://codio.com) or by going to [http://codio.com/p/signup](http://codio.com/p/signup).

You can sign in with Codio or GitHub. If you signin with GitHub, your account will be associated with GitHub from that point on. 

You can also associate your account with a GitHub account from the Codio->Account menu item.


##2. Create a Project
Once you have signed in, you can [create a new project](/docs/console/creating) by clicking on the Create Project link in the Dashboard. 

There are several ways to start off

- Create a blank project (HTML Boilerplate, PHP Basic or completely empty)
- Import from a ZIP file
- Import from FTP/SFTP
- Import from Git/Mercurial
- A SalesForce project

All of these are full described [here](/docs/console/creating).

##3. You're in the IDE
Once you're in the IDE, which you will be automatically after creating a project or opening an existing one, you're ready to start coding.

The most important thing is for you to be aware of the features that are available so you can take advantage of them when you need them. Here are two feature pages that give you an idea of some of the things you can do with Codio

- TODO IDE Features
- TODO Back End 'Box' features

##4. A bit about 'Boxes'
Whenever you create a project, you automatically get a back-end server 'Box' with it. The Box comes preconfigured with 

- Node (including NVM)
- Ruby (including RVM)
- more languages available soon (PHP and Python are planned). Please feel free to request support at support@codio.com.

You can access your Box from 'Tools->Terminal'. You can also configure your own terminal commands from the [Run menu](/docs/boxes/run). General Box documentation can be [found here](/docs/boxes).

Take a look at the Box features page : TODO
