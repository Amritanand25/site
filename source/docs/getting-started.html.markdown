This explains the key things you should know in order to get the most out of the Codio IDE in as short a time as possible.

##1. Signup
Signing up is effortless and gives you access to the complete set of features. Any public projects you create are (and will always be) free.

Signup from the signup link at the top of the page at [Codio.com](http://codio.com) or by going to [http://codio.com/p/signup](http://codio.com/p/signup).


##2. Create a Project
Once you have signed in, you can create a new project by clicking on the Create Project link in the Dashboard. 

You can start off by 

- creating a blank HTML5 Boilerplate project
- creating an empty project
- creating a project from a template
- importing an existing project from a Git, Mercurial or ZIP project

##3. You're in the IDE
Once you're in the IDE, which you will be automatically after creating a project or opening an existing one, you're ready to start coding.

The most important thing is for you to be aware of the features that are available so you can take advantage of them when you need them. Here's a list ...

- [Preferences & Settings](/docs/settings-prefs) : customize actions, settings and keyboard shortcuts
- [Productivity Features](/docs/emmet) : keyboard shortcuts, snippets, TernJS, autocomplete, code beautification and more
- [Panel Management](/docs/panels) : create panels in any configuration you want
- [Git](/docs/git) : access your Github and other repos from a Codio Panel with great Git support
- [Deployment](/docs/deployment) : create and manage any number of deployment targets per project
- [Bower](/docs/bower) : we have baked Bower directly into Codio
- [CoffeeScript, Sass, SCSS and Less](/docs/compiling) : edit and preview without any special compilation required
- [Annotations](/docs/annotations) : annotate your code projects so people can get a guided tour or simply explore a project and get properly documented explanations
- [SalesForce.com](/docs/salesforce) : this is a Codio experiment that lets anyone access their SalesForce.com Classes, Pages and Triggers
