If you are not part of a schools, university, colleges or other such organisation then you do not need to read this section.

In most cases, your teacher will have added you to a Codio Class. You can find a list of all Classes you are assigned to in the Codio Dashboard.

## Modules
Select the Class and you will be shown a list of Modules your teacher has assigned to the Class. If you don't see any Modules, then your teacher has not yet assigned any Modules.

## Units
Select a Module and you will see a list of all Units for the selected Module. You will normally progress through each of these in sequence.

When you click on the Start Unit button (circled) the Unit will be forked into your account and started. This may take a few seconds. Any projects you have already started can be opened from the Units list as well

## Projects Listing
If you click on the Projects link, you will see that your Unit can also be accessed from the Projects listing. Projects are listed in most recently used order, so you should see your recent work appear automatically at the top of the listing. Just click on the Project to start it up and carry on where you left off.
