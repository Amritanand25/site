Codio is pleased to sponsor tutorials and blog posts that relate to front-end web development. To get an overview please take a look at [this page](/home-sponblog).

##What's the point?
However well written your tutorial or blog post is, most readers benefit enormously from being able to see and play with a full set of working code. It's even better if they can actually run the code as well.

Codio is a Web IDE that can be accessed by someone without needing a Codio account. So all you need do is to import your code (from Git, Mercurial, FTP, SFTP or ZIP) and you can simply link to it from your tutorial.

This way the general tutorial content is reinforced and being able to see everything in context, using a Web IDE that dramatically enhances the learning process.

##Codio Annotations
Annotations enhances the process even more. By simply embedding tokens in your source code, which are linked to descriptive text in a markdown file, your readers are able to explore the project and see the annotations. You can also offer a guided tour of the code.

Please refer to the [documentation](/docs/annotations) for more information on Annotations.

##Apply for acceptance
In order to get sponsorship, please go the [overview page](/home-sponblog) and scroll to the bottom, where you will find an application form.

Once you have completed this, we will get back to you with the amount we will offer. We have a limited amount of funds for this at the moment and so we will accept applications accordingly.

##Signup for a Codio Account
You will need a Codio account to load your code into. You can then [create a project](/docs/console/creating) by importing from Git, Mercurial, FTP, SFTP or a ZIP file.

##Write your tutorial
You can write your main tutorial content any way you like. You don't have to change anything about the way you would normally do this. 

What we strongly suggest is that you take a look at [Codio Annotations](/docs/annotations) as a great new way of structuring some of your content.

##Add Codio buttons
In order to link to the IDE, you should use the Codio buttons. The [Project->Share menu item](/docs/sharing) gives you buttons with associated HTML or markdown code that you can paste straight into your own page.

##Terms & Conditions
The full terms and conditions are explained in full in the [Sponsored Blog Terms & Conditions](/legal/sponblog) page.
