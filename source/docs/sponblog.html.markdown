Codio is pleased to sponsor tutorials and blog posts that relate to programming. To get an overview please take a look at [this page](/home-sponblog).

##What's the point?
However well written your tutorial or blog post, most readers benefit enormously from being able to browse the source code that the tutorial is based on - in a real IDE. It's even better if they can actually run the code as well, which they can for HTML5 type tutorials.

Codio is a Web IDE that can be accessed just by clicking on a link and without having to sign up for anything. Simply import your code project (from Git, Mercurial, FTP, SFTP or ZIP) and then link to it from your tutorial.

This way the general tutorial content is reinforced and being able to see everything in context, using a Web IDE that dramatically enhances the learning process.

##So show me an example
Click on the 'SHOW ME THE CODE' link below to see a project in the Codio IDE. This project actually uses Codio Annotations (which you don't have to use), so you can try out the following

- in the file tree, click on a blue icon to see an explanation of the file
- open `index.html` and click on the blue icons in the gutter 
- select 'Tools->Annotations Tour` for a guided tour of the code. Click the `>` button to navigate. Click the icon next to the navigation buttons to go full-screen.

##Codio Annotations
Annotations enhances the process even more. By simply embedding tokens in your source code, which are linked to descriptive text in a markdown file, your readers are able to explore the project and see the annotations. You can also offer a guided tour of the code.

The SHOW ME THE CODE example described above is a good example of an annotated project.

Please refer to the [documentation](/docs/annotations) for more information on Annotations.

If you make full use of Annotations in your project, we will add 15% to your monthly payments.

##Application Form
In order to get sponsorship, please go the [overview page](/home-sponblog) and scroll to the bottom, where you will find an application form.

Once you have completed this, we will get back to you to confirm acceptance.

##Signup & Import your code
Authors need a Codio account to load their code into. You can then [create a project](/docs/console/creating) by importing from Git, Mercurial, FTP, SFTP or a ZIP file.

##Write your tutorial
You can write your main tutorial content any way you like. You don't have to change anything about the way you would normally do this. 

What we strongly suggest is that you take a look at [Codio Annotations](/docs/annotations) as a great new way of structuring some of your content.

##Add Codio buttons
In order to link to the IDE, you should use the Codio buttons. The [Project->Share menu item](/docs/sharing) gives you buttons with associated HTML or markdown code that you can paste straight into your own page.

##Terms & Conditions
The full terms and conditions are explained in full in the [Sponsored Blog Terms & Conditions](/legal/sponblog) page.
