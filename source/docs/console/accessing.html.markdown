To view a project in the IDE, simply click on one of your projects.

You can order your project list by Name/Visibility/Owner/Last Opened and whether the project is [clonable](/docs/boxes/clone)

You can also search for a project by typing into the Search field and the file list will dynamically filter for you as you type.

![Search](/img/docs/console-find.png)

You can search for multiple criteria as well.
For example to find all projects starting with 'f' and owned by 'igo' enter `f owner:igo`
