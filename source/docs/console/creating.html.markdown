Creating a new project or importing one is really easy. All you do is click on the Create Project link in the Dashboard as shown below.

![Create Project](docs/console-create.png)

You will then be shown a dialog that lets you choose the various ways to create or import a project.

##Templates
Until we have completed the integration of Yo into Codio (will be available in 2013), we offer a template system. You will find the Template option in the dropdown list next to the Create Project radio button. 

As soon as you select it, it will take you to a new page where all the templates are listed. You can click on a template project to view it in the IDE. If you want to use it, you select Project->Fork and it will create a fork in your account.

Most of the template projects have been generated using Yo.
