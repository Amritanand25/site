You can specify a start and a stop date and time for a unit. The unit will be disabled prior to the start date at which point it becomes available to students in their dashboard. 

Once the stop date and time is reached you can set the unit to be marked as complete and/or disabled. If you elect to disable access, then depending on your [disabled Unit settings](/docs/classes/unitmanagement/settings-info/disable) students will either be refused all access or can have read-only access to the Unit.

This feature is accessible via the main settings tab.
