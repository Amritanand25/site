A contact URL can be set at the class level so if you have specific areas/forums for your classes for students to raise questions, you can set the contact URL there and it will override the [organisation contact url](/docs/dashboard/create/orgcontacturl) if set

- Select the class, go to the **Admin** area and **Edit Details** where you can then enter a URL to direct students to when they use any of the Contact us options.

**N.B. "Teacher" accounts will not be effected by this setting and they will still be able to contact Codio in the usual manner. See [Support](/docs/dashboard/support/) for more on this**
