You can add a new unit by pressing the **Add Unit** button where you can start a new project either creating a new project or importing an existing project as the unit. See [Creating and Importing](/docs/project/creating/) for more information.

If you have already created a project in your account, click in the **Click Here**, select the **Fork Project** option and select the Project. The Stack used in your project will be used in the Unit including any additional software or components you may have added to the project

You can also import in from other sources if for example you have work stored at GitHub/BitBucket/Mecurial etc by selecting the **Import** option.

### Publishing the Unit

By default the unit is only visible to you and is not visible to any other users.

When you are ready to publish your unit for it to be accessible to others, you will need to publish it. You can do this in either of the following ways.

- Within the unit, go to **Education>Publish Unit** menu item

- Select the unit from the listing and then press **Publish**.
