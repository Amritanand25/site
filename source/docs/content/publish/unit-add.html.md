You can also import in from other sources if required selecting the **Import** option.

### Publishing the Unit

By default the unit is only visible to you and is not visible to any other users.

When you are ready to publish your unit for it to be accessible to others, you will need to publish it. You can do this in either of the following ways.

- Within the unit, go to **Education>Publish Unit** menu item

- Select the unit from the listing and then press **Publish**.
