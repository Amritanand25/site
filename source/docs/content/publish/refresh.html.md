When you create a unit, a snapshot is taken of the Codio project from which that unit is taken. If you make a change to the project, the unit is not automatically updated. This is to ensure that any edits you are making are not seen by students.

### Editing Units

To edit a unit, select it in the Module listing

<img alt="editunit" src="/img/docs/editunit.png" class="simple"/>

Select **Edit** where you can change the name of the unit shown to other users, the description of the unit and also the image associated with the unit

Select **Edit in IDE** to open the unit in the IDE where you can make changes to the content of the unit. The project will be opened for you (or created for you if necessary) from the snapshot of the last published version. to enable you to make the necessary changes. 

### Deleting Units
Select **Delete** from the above screen to delete the unit. 

<img alt="deleteunit" src="/img/docs/deleteunit.png" class="simple"/>

You are required to enter a confirmation code to proceed and you can then either just delete the Unit from the module and retain the source project (select **Delete Unit and leave Author Project**) or you can delete the unit and also original source project (select **Delete Unit and Author Project**). 

### Publishing Units

When you are ready to publish any edits, you will need to publish a new version of the unit. You can do this in either of the following ways.

- Within the unit, go to **Education>Publish Unit** menu item

- Select the unit from the listing and then press **Publish New Version**.

<img alt="publishversion" src="/img/docs/publishversionnew.png" class="simple"/>

- If you are on the Edit unit screen, press the **Publish new version** button.

<img alt="versions" src="/img/docs/versions.png" class="simple"/>

Details of the changes made are available in the Versions area of the Unit.


When you have published the new version in the Course, you can then push the updated content to your students in your [Class](/docs/teacher/classes/).

If you require students that have already started the unit to start again 'as new' you can reset the unit in the class, either for the whole class or for individual students. See [Reset Unit](/docs/teacher/classes/reset-unit) for more information


If you would not require them to start the unit again from the beginning but just to see the updated content you can update the unit in the Class selecting 'Update Unit' from the 3 blue vertical dots to the right of the unit listed in the class. See [Unit settings and actions](/docs/teacher/classes/settings/) for more on this.
