A course is always made up on at least one module. A module contains the individual units that students interact with. Modules help you organize your units into logical groupings. If your course only contains a few units then you may want only a single module. If, on the other hand, your course has a large number of units, then dividing them up may make more organizational sense.

## Creating a module
To create a new, empty module, press the **Create Module** button. You can also re-use a module that is located in another course as explained below.

## Adding a Module
It is possible to add a module to your course that already exists in another course. Press the **Add Module** button. 
The Module browser will open for you to search for the module(s) you wish to add. 

You can filter from the available options in the tabs, or search by simply typing into the search field, whereupon Codio will search within all Module names, descriptions and owner fields and filter your list accordingly.

You can also order the list of modules by name or owner and use the 'Filter by Course' drop down to view modules in other courses.
