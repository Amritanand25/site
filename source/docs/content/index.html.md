An **assessment library** in Codio is a collection of existing assessment items.

You can create assessments libraries within your organization. You can organize your libraries by course number, programming language, department, etc.

You can use exisiting assessments from Codio's Global library.

To navigate through an assessments library, you filter based on tags. The Codio library has a number of tags - your organization can come up with a convention that works for you!
