**Please note that we have recently re factored the assessment dialog screens. The documentation will be updated shortly to reflect the changes but if you have any questions please don't hesitate to [contact us](/docs/dashboard/support/)**

Codio support both single and multiple response versions of MCQs.

## Assessment definition
To configure an MCQ, specify the following.

- **Name** is a short name that describes the assessment. This name will appear in teacher dashboards, so naming it clearly is important so teachers can see precisely which challenges are successfully met (or not) by students. In many cases, you do not want to see this text appear within the challenge text the student sees. To suppress this text, flip the **Show Name** switch next to the name field.
- **Question** is the question instruction that is shown to the student.
- **Correct Points** is the score given to the student if the student makes the correct selection. You can choose any positive numeric value.
- **Incorrect Points** is the score to be deducted if the student makes an incorrect selection. Typically, this value will be 0 but you can assign any positive numeric value if you wish to penalize guessing.
- The **Multiple Response** slider indicates whether the user can select more than one answer, in which case check boxes are used instead of radio buttons to specify correct answers.
- **Answers** is where you add as many individual answers as you require. To indicate the correct answer(s), adjust the sliders for multiple response or the radio button for single response.
- **Show Expected Answer** will show the students the correct answer when they have submitted an answer for this question. To suppress this, flip the switch.
- **Answer and Rationale** is where guidance for the assessment can be entered. This will be visible to the teacher when the project is opened using the [Open as Teacher](/docs/classes/unitmanagement/settings-info/teachersolutions) method. This guidance information can also be shown to students after they have submitted their answer and also if they reload the unit after marking it as completed. To enable this, flip the **Show Answer and Rationale to Student** switch below the guidance field.

## Once chance only!!
Codio allows users to make their selections and move on to other content pages or assessments without actually submitting their answer. However, once the answer has been submitted, it cannot be resubmitted. This gives teachers a far clearer understanding of which students are understanding the materials properly. There is little point to tests if the student simply changes the answers until the correct one appears.
