## Global Assessments Library

The Global Assessments Library is an assessments library that all Codio users have read-only access to. The library contains auto-graded assessment questions covering a wide variety of topics, difficulties, and assessment types. We are currently populating it with assessments in:

* Java
* C / C++
* Python
* JavaScript
* Data Structures (in Java)

## Features of Global Library

All assessments in the global library are auto-graded, there is no manual grading necessary. All assessments also contain example solutions and answer explanations for the student. Some will also have teacher notes to help better convey the intended learning objective of the assessment.

## Using the Global Library

Using the library is similar to using any other assessment library in your organization. Simply go to the assessments drop-down in the guides editor, click on "Assessment Library", and choose the **[PLACEHOLDER PUT NAME OF LIBRARY HERE]** under "Library Name".

You can filter through the different assessments by programming language, class, assessment type, Bloom's Taxonomy level, content, and more. Once you find a suitable assessment, simply click "Select" to add it to your project.
