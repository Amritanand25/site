One really useful thing you can do is to be writing your markdown and at the same time see the output being rendered in Play mode, the way a student will see it.

One way to handle things is to  switch Layout mode to Split View mode by selecting the 2nd from left button in the header bar.

You should now have something like the screenshot below. As you enter your Markdown content in the Guide editor, you will see the Preview window updated simultaneously.

Another option you can use is to switch the Layout mode to Preview mode rather than Split View where you can preview the content as the student will see it with your [Panel layout](/docs/content/authoring/layouts/) configurations as well and then easily switch back to Editor mode from the Editor button.

You can also manage your own custom panel configuration at any time as [explained here](/docs/ide/panels/).
