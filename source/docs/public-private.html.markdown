By default, all Codio projects are public. Anyone who has your account URL (for example [https://codio.com/codio](https://codio.com/codio) ), will be able to see and view your public projects. They cannot edit them although they are free to fork them into their own account or anonymously. We are shortly going to be adding explore features so you can search for 3rd party accounts and projects.

If you do not want your project to be visible to third parties, then you should make your project private. There are three ways to manage this

- When you [create a project](/docs/console/creating) you will see the options for making the project public or private
- If you are in the IDE, then you can select the `Project > Settings` menu item

## Private Projects & Paid Accounts
To create mpre than one private project you will need to purchase a paid subscription. See [Paid Subscriptions](/docs/subscriptions/).

## Exploring Public Projects
We have not yet added any real functionality to let you explore public accounts and projects, but this will be coming before very long. We will also add support for Watching, Starring, Tagging and other GitHub-like features.
