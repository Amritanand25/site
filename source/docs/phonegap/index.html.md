Phonegap should be considered to be in a Beta state until mention of it is removed from the documentation.

'Tools>Phonegap' allows you to build your projects (set up in the usual way for PhoneGap/Cordova projects) using Phonegap:Build platform

In order to use PhoneGap:Build, you will need a PhoneGap:Build account. If you do not have one click [here](https://build.phonegap.com/) to access the site and set one up.

PhoneGap:Build supports a maximum project size of 15mb. If you have a paid [Creative Cloud](https://creative.adobe.com/plans) account or a Phonegap:Build [monthly paid subscription](https://build.phonegap.com/plans) then the maximum project size is 40mb.
