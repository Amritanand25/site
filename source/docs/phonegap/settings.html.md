##Private Application

Depending on the Phonegap:Build account plan you have, you can build a number of private applications. Check this box if you want to build as a private application. See [here](https://build.phonegap.com/plans) for more information on Phonegap:Build plans

##Enable Debug

Checking this box enables Phonegap Build debugging to allow you to use standard Web Inspector tools available from the PhoneGap Build site to debug PhoneGap apps while they are running on your device.

For more information on this see [Remote Debugging Tools](http://docs.build.phonegap.com/en_US/debugging_remote_debugging_tools.md.html#Remote%20Debugging%20Tools)

##Enable Hydrates

Checking this box enables Phonegap:Build Hydration. Hydration is a tool that has two main benefits for developers and testers:

- Compilation times are improved significantly.
- Updates are pushed directly to the application installed on a device.

For more information on this see [Remote Debugging Tools](http://docs.build.phonegap.com/en_US/tools_hydration.md.html#Hydration)
