To access Phonegap:Build from Codio you will need to set up an Authentication token. This is available in your Phonegap:Build account.
Go to your Phonegap [account](https://build.phonegap.com/people/edit) details and select `Client Application` tab. If you do not see an authentication token, click `Reset` to obtain one

In Codio, select the `Change` button and paste your key in there
