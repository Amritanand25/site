Codio is the perfect platform for teaching coding. Here are a list of benefits of using Codio for teaching and learning

- Students can access their code from anywhere using just a browser.
- There is no software to install on classroom machines, nor on student machines.
- [Stacks]() and [Starter Packs]() allow teachers to pre-configure entire environments for learning, includin languages, databases, web servers, components and even entire code workspaces.
- [Tutorials]() allow teachers to group and order teaching Projects into logical courses.
- [Codio Guides]() lets teachers author rich content within the Codio IDE using simple markdown. These Guides can then run in one panel while the student codes in another.
- [Classrooms]() let you organize define a class of students and then assign Tutorials to them. You can then access Students' code from the class list as well as Grading them. Classrooms is only available with an Organization account.

##Organizations
In order to get the most out of Codio, we recommend you create an Organization. You can request a trial of this from the [Subscriptions]() page. Functionality such as Classrooms is only available with an Organization account.

All Organization account users, teachers and students, are able to create Private projects.

##Codio Guides
If you are teaching coding and want to author your own teaching content that runs within the IDE, then we strongly recommend you look at [Codio Guides](). They are easy to create and hugely helpful. 

##When do I need to pay?
We operate an honour system. You can use Codio for free if you are teaching less than 20 students within your school or university. Above this, we ask you to purchase and Organization account, which you can do from the [Subscriptions]() section.

We offer huge discounts on our professional pricing to schools and universities.
