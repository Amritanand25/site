A [Module](/docs/dashboard/modules/) is a collection of teaching resources that have been grouped and ordered. It is an ideal way of giving students access to a coherent set of Projects aimed at teaching any coding topic you like.

When combined with [Classes](/docs/dashboard/classes/), you get a powerful way of teaching a class of students that let's you organize, review student code and grade.

Anyone creating a Module should utilise [Codio Guides](/docs/ide/tools/guides/), a rich content authoring tool for publishing content that allows students to view instructions while they edit their code.

A [Course](/docs/dashboard/courses/) allows you to group any modules you wish together into a course, and you can also access courses in the creation of your [Classes](/docs/dashboard/classes) using the 'Filter by Courses' drop down option
