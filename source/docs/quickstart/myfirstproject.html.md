The first thing you will want to do is to create a new Project and try some coding. Check out the options below and why not start off by using a Starter Pack (see below)?

A project is a combination of a Box and your code workspace. When you open up your projects, the IDE file tree will be pointed to the code workspace automatically and can be found at `~/codio~workspace`. 

Start off by ...

- clicking on the `Projects` option on the left of your Dashoard.
- click the `Create Project` button in the top right of the screen

When you create a new Project, you can optionally specify the following items that drastically speed up the overall project setup

- Select a [Stack]() which allows you to select your software dependencies from a list of Codio Certified Stacks or from Stacks that you have created earlier yourself.
- Or a [Starter Pack]() which is the combination of a Stack and a pre-configured code workspace. This option means you can create complete Stack + Code templates that get you off to a flying start.
- If you are a student, you can also check out [Tutorials](), which are collections of several projects grouped and ordered into a coherent set of Projects and incorporate [Codio Guides](), giving you on-screen instructions while you code.
