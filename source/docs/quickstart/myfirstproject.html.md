The first thing you will want to do is to create a new Project and try some coding. Check out the options below and why not start off by using a Starter Pack (see below)?

A project is a combination of a Box and your code workspace. When you open up your projects, the IDE file tree will be pointed to the code workspace automatically and can be found at `~/codio~workspace`. 

Start off by ...

- clicking on the `Projects` option on the left of your Dashoard.
- click the `New Project` button in the top right of the screen

You can then choose which of the following Project creation methods you want to use

Select a commonly used Stack:

- **LAMP:** LAMP Stack containing PHP, Apache and MySql with no code workspace
- **Python3:** Python3 Stack with no code workspace
- **Codio Base Stack:** an empty Ubuntu Box with no code workspace (suitable for HTML/CSS/JS projects)

or 

Select an alternative software configuration where you can:

- Select a [Stack](/docs/quickstart/stacks/) which allows you to select your software dependencies from a list of Codio Certified Stacks or from Stacks that you have created earlier yourself.
- Or a [Starter Pack](/docs/quickstart/packs/) which is the combination of a Stack and a pre-configured code workspace. This option means you can create complete Stack + Code templates that get you off to a flying start.
- Or import code in from Git, Mercurial, FTP, SFTP or a Zip file.
- If you are a student, you can also check out [Modules](/docs/quickstart/modules/), which are collections of several projects grouped and ordered into a coherent set of Projects and incorporate [Codio Guides](/docs/ide/tools/guides/), giving you on-screen instructions while you code.
