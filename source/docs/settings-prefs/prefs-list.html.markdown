Keyboard bindings are different for Windows/Linux and Mac systems but you can find your settings in the following ways:

- [Command Bar](/docs/command-bar) where as you start typing the list will refine as you type.
- `Help > Shortcuts` where you can also search and the list will refine as you type
- `Codio > Preferences > User` where a complete list is shown in the Default Preferences area.


To change your preferences see [Codio Preferences](/docs/settings-prefs/codio-prefs/)
