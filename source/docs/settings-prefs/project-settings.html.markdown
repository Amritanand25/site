These settings are found within the IDE (a loaded project) from the `Project > Settings` menu item.

Project settings, as distinct from Project preferences, are used to store the following details about the project

- Project Name
- Project Description
- Public/Private

but also where (as a subscriber) you can enable your box to be [cloned](/docs/boxes/clone) by other users.
