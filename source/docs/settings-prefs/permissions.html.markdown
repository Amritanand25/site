You modify permissions by selecting **Permissions** from the **Project** dropdown menu.

![Permissions Dialog](/img/docs/permissions-dlg.png)

By default:

- Anyone can see a public project
- No-one can edit a public project (but they can fork it)
- No-one can see a private project

Changing permissions allows you to give the following access permissions to Users and/or Teams.

- **Read** - View the project only
- **Write** - Edit the project
- **Admin** - Coming soon, we will be adding this functionality shortly and you will then be able to assign admin rights to other Team members within your Organization.

## Adding/Removing a User
To add a new user, start typing the user name in the text field. When you find the user, click Add and that user will be added to the list of users below.

You can remove a user from the list by clicking the 'x' button.
