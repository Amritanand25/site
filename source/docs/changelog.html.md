This page contains a list of recent updates made to the Codio platform. We update Codio regularly, sometimes several times a day and so this page should provide information to help you figure out what we have changed.

We do not report small bug fixes or issues that affect individual users, who we will notify directly.

####April 7th, 2014
- ** Bug**: some users reported some corruption of file if the same file was opened in more than one location with the same user account.

####April 4th, 2014
- **Feature**: Improved mode switching for editing of Markdown files. [More information...](/blog/tags/changelog/)

{Ian - please go back a couple of weeks with added features and link to Blog and/or docs}


##End
We only implemented the changelog page on April 7th, 2014 so this is as far back as we go.
