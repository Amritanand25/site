##How does the billing process work?
Billing works as follows.

- As soon as you subscribe, you credit card will be debited
- You will have usage for one month from this date
- Your card will be debited automatically on about the same date each month
- If you cancel, which you can do at any time, usage will continue as a paid up user until the month expires at which point your private projects will be disabled
- Afterwards, you can enable these projects manually at which point they will become public
