Codio is free for all public projects. However, if you want to work on private projects that no-one else can access or to allow your project box to be [cloned](/docs/boxes/clone), you will need to purchase a paid subscription.

Current pricing information can be found at [https://codio.com/s/pricing/](https://codio.com/s/pricing/)

## Codio Deployment Target Type
We offer several ways to deploy your apps, and one of those involves that we host your static content. This is called the Codio deployment type. This type is only available to users with a subscription. All other deployment types are still free no matter if you have a Subscription or not.

##How to buy
There are two ways you can buy a subscription

- From the `Codio > Subscription` menu item
- When you try to make a public project private and do not have an active subscription.

##Not yet subscribed
In this case you will see the following screen and you can enter your credit/debit card details.

##Purchase History & Invoices
You will be able to find this from the `Codio > Subscription` menu item.

##How does the billing process work?
Billing works as follows.

- As soon as you subscribe, you credit/debit card will be debited
- You will have usage for one month from this date
- Your card will be debited automatically on about the same date each month
- If you cancel, which you can do at any time, usage will continue as a paid up user until the month expires at which point your private projects will be disabled
- Afterwards, you can enable these projects manually at which point they will become public

##Changing Credit/Debit Card Details
You can change your card details at any time by going to the `Codio > Subscription` menu item and clicking on the 'Card Details' tab.

##Group Subscriptions
We do not currently offer this but it is planned in the near future. This will allow a company to manage centralized payment for a group of users.
