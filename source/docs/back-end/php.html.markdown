If you want to develop PHP 100% in the cloud, without the need to install anything at all on your local machine and you don't yet have a Cloud Server, then we recommend you head over to Digital Ocean and spin up a LAMP server. 

We've go a complete [Start to Finish Tutorial](/docs/back-end/do-server) and video, which explains all the steps from creating a Digital Ocean cloud server, importing, coding and deploying. It shows a Wordpress based example but is just as good for any PHP application.
