If you want to develop PHP 100% in the cloud, without the need to install anything at all on your local machine and you don't yet have a Cloud Server, then we recommend you head over to Digital Ocean and spin up a LAMP server. 

You should then go to the [Quick Start](/docs/back-end/quick-start) and follow the steps described there.
