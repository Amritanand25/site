Codio offers excellent support for back end development. In order to give our users maximum flexibility and choice, we let you work with any 3rd party back-end servers.

We strongly recommend Digital Ocean as our server partner as they provide great value-for-money and ease-of-use. In fact, we will soon be allowing you to create and control Digital Ocean servers from within Codio.

However, you can connect Codio effortlessly to any remote servers and our [SSH Terminal](/docs/ssh) capability lets you SSH into any number of remote servers from within your project.

We strongly recommend looking at the [Start to Finish Tutorial](/docs/back-end/do-server/) which shows how to use Codio for back-end development.
