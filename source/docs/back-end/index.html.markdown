Codio offers support for back end development. In order to give our users maximum flexibility and choice, we let you work with any 3rd party back-end servers.

##Working with your existing hosting provider
If you already work with a hosting provider and you want to remain there then you can set up a deployment target to that provider. 

The best and fastest approach is to use [RSYNC](/docs/deployment/type-rsync) but not all providers provide SSH access, which is required for RSYNC.

If your hosting provider does not support RSYNC, then Codio allows you to [deploy the current file, or selected files and folders](/docs/deployment/specific-files/) to FTP or SFTP servers from the file tree.

##Using Digital Ocean & Other cloud servers
We strongly recommend Digital Ocean as our server partner as they provide great value-for-money and ease-of-use. In fact, we will soon be allowing you to create and control Digital Ocean servers from within Codio.

However, you can connect Codio effortlessly to any remote servers and our [SSH Terminal](/docs/ssh) capability lets you SSH into any number of remote servers from within your project.

We strongly recommend looking at the [Start to Finish Tutorial](/docs/back-end/do-server/) which shows how to use Codio for back-end development.
