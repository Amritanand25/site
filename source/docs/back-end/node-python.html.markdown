If you want to develop Node, Ruby, Python or other back end languages 100% in the cloud, without the need to install anything at all on your local machine and you don't yet have a Cloud Server, then we recommend you head over to Digital Ocean and spin up a server. You can then use Codio's own [SSH Terminal](/docs/ssh) to install and configure whatever you need on the server.

You should go to the [Quick Start](/docs/back-end/quick-start) and follow the steps described there.
