If you want to develop Node, Ruby, Python or other back end languages 100% in the cloud, without the need to install anything at all on your local machine and you don't yet have a Cloud Server, then we recommend you head over to Digital Ocean and spin up a server. You can then use Codio's own [SSH Terminal](/docs/ssh) to install and configure whatever you need on it.

We've got a complete [Start to Finish Tutorial](/docs/back-end/do-server) and video, which explains all the steps from creating a Digital Ocean cloud server, importing, coding and deploying. It shows a Wordpress based example but shows the steps for most use cases.
