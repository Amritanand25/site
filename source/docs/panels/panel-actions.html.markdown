Codio lets you manage panels using either hotkeys or from the View->Panels menu.

##Reset to Default Layout
If you want to quickly go back to a basic IDE layout, then this is easily done.

`Mac : Cmd+Alt+1`
`Mac : Ctrl+Alt+1`

Menu : View->Default Layout

##Split Vertical
This splits the selected panel by drawing a vertical line down the middle, so you end up with two panels side by side.

`Mac : Cmd+Alt+2`
`Mac : Ctrl+Alt+2`

##Split Horizontal
This splits the selected panel by drawing a horizontal line across the middle, so you end up with one panel on top of the new panel.

`Mac : Cmd+Alt+2`
`Mac : Ctrl+Alt+2`

##Close Panel
This will close the selected panel and all the tabs within it.

`Mac : Cmd+Alt+0`
`Mac : Ctrl+Alt+0`

##Restore File Tree
If you deliberately or inadvertently close the file tree, you can restore it from the View->Open/Show File Tree menu.
