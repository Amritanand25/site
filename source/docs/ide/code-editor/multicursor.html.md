You can select multiple cursors using Cmd+click (Mac) or Ctrl+click (PC/Linux).

Click to place the cursor at the desired location, then press and hold Cmd/Ctrl and begin clicking at new locations. When you release Cmd/Ctrl, you can start styping and the content will be duplicated at all cursor locations.

Here you can see how we have created several cursors and then typed "hello world" once so it is duplicated across several lines.
