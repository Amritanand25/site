Codio will automatically select the syntax highlighting rules solely based on the file extension.

If you open a file whose extension is not know then you will not get any highlighting of the code. You can tell Codio which language formatting to use by clicking at the bottom right of the IDE.

You can override the language highlighting by clicking as shown (circled) in the above screenshot.
