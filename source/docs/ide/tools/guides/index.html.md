Codio Guides is a fully integrated content authoring tool that allows you to write rich tutorial type content using pure markdown.

We would recommend that you check out our [Guides Cheat Sheet](https://bitbucket.org/codiocontent/guides-cheat-sheet) and import into your Codio account to review. See [here](/docs/dashboard/projects/creating/) for more infomation on importing.

##Why should I use it?
If you are creating any type of coding tutorial or you are creating educational content using [Codio's Education features](/docs/quickstart/education), then you will find this enormously helpful.

##Key Features

- all content written using simple markdown
- create any number of sections within your Guide
- re-order sections with drag and drop
- optionally style your own output with CSS overrides
- specify files to automatically open with each section
- highlight code blocks within your code referenced from your Guide section
- choose from a selection of panel layouts
- hide and show table of contents while in both edit and play modes
