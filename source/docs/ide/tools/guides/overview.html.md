A Codio project can have a single Guide. Within that Guide you can have as many sections as you like.

To create a new Guide, or to edit an existing one, go to the 'Tools->Edit Guide' menu option.

Having selected 'Edit Guides' you will see your Guides window appear.

Use the Layout modes to switch between preview,code,split and full screen modes

## Anatomy of the Guides Editor

## Editor Functions
Within the editor is a toolbar which gives you access to the key functions.

- **Theme** allows you to select the default theme for people viewing the Guide. We current have a dark theme 'Charcoal' and a light one 'Paper'. (Dyslexic users can also choose a special theme from the Cog icon in the Guide player. See [Dyslexia Support](/docs/ide/tools/guides/dyslexia/) section for details)
- **Scripts** allows you to point to one or more `.js` files in your project (usually you would have this somewhere within the `.guides` folder) that is run when the page is shown. This is especially useful when interacting with a Guide button. Refer to the [Custom Button](/docs/ide/tools/guides/button/) section for details.
- **Step Path** allows you to define specific folders in your project that you wish to be visible when the current section is displayed
- **Layout** allows you to specify the panel layout you want to choose for this section
- **Close Tabs** allows you to close all tabs open from previous section
- **Open Tabs** allows you to specify:
    - which files you want to automatically open when the current section is displayed,
    - Preview (including external websites),
    - Open a Terminal window (including running a terminal command in the background,
    - which lines (if any) you wish to highlight within each file
- **Hamburger Icon** can be pressed to show or hide the Section List. See [here](docs/ide/tools/guides/collapse/) for details
- **Section List** lists the sections in your Guide. You can add new ones and re-order the list by dragging
