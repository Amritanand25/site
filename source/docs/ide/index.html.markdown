The Codio IDE should be extremely intuitive for anyone used to working with other IDEs.

However, there are a number of things that you should be aware of that make Codio such a great product to work with.

[TODO:links below]

- It is highly customizable. You can configure your preferences at the User and Project level.
- Codio has very sophisticated multi-pane support, allowing you to open files in as many preciedly configurable panels as you like.
- Most things open up in a tab, which means that you don't get modal dialogs blocking everything.
- Codio has support for Ternjs and Emmet, which means you have very powerful productivity features at your fingertips, especially if you are working on HTML, CSS or JS files.
- We've integrated Bower right into the IDE so component management is a joy. We'll be adding Grunt soon, too.
- Git is integrated so you can push and pull from Github (and other systems) just as easily as you would on your desktop
- There's really nice support for Coffeescript, Less, SCSS and Sass without the need to compile to Preview. 
- You can deploy directly from Codio to both Codio hosted production targets as well as any FTP, SFTP server and also Nodejitsu and Parse.com
- For those writing tutorials, we have a unique 'Annotations' feature that lets you comment your code and provide guided tours to anyone wanting to understand a project better.
