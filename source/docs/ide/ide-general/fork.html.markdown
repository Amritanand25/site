You can fork any 3rd party public project into your account. If you are not signed into an account then this will create a new anonymous project URL and a cookie will be planted on your PC so that you can edit it in the future. 

You will only be able to edit it from the same PC and browser that owns the project unless you note down the URL, in which case it can be used form anywhere.

If you are looking at a forked project, then it will look like this

[TODO: update image]
![Fork project](/img/docs/fork-ide.png)

If you are signed into Codio, forking a project will create the fork in your account.
