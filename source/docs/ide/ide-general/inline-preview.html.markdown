##Menu
You will find 'Preview' in the menu at the top of the page. This will look for index.html in the root of your project and run it in the preview window. 

##Right-Click
If you want to run a specific file, then right-click the file and select Preview.

##Keyboard
Press the 'Shortcuts' link in the bar at the bottom of the IDE and select Inline Preview tab to see all Preview options.

##Inline or Dedicated Browser Tab
By default, Preview will create an inline preview, as shown in the screenshot below.
