Codio offers 2 ways to run your application in Preview mode

##Preview Menu Option
You will find this in the menu at the top of the page. This will look for index.html in the root of your project and run it in the preview window. 

##Right-Click Option
If you want to run a specific file, then right-click the file and select Preview.


##Inline or Dedicated Browser Tab
By default, Preview will create an inline preview, as shown in the screenshot below.

There are 3 icons in the top of the Preview window 

1. **Close** - press the 'x' button
1. **Expand** - press the small arrow icon to expand the preview into its own browser tab
1. **Refresh** - if you have made any changes to you code, you can press the refresh button to reload.
