Codio offers dual mode preview.

1. When you press Preview in the top menu bar, an inline preview window will open up.
1. You can then expand that into a full screen preview in its own browser tab.

If you have the inline preview pane visible, it will auto-refresh as soon as you save a file you are editing.
