Codio currently has full development support for the following source file types **but** in a way that means you can instantly run and preview your application without any manual compilation steps whatsoever.

- [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) (.coffee)
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) (.sass)
- [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) (yes, same place as Sass) (.scss)
- [Less](http://lesscss.org/) (.less)
- [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (.md)


**We will not be supporting these for much longer, but see the relevant sites above which all have full documentation on how you can easily handle this yourself**

Now read the [Overview](/docs/ide/features/compiling/overview) section for details on how best to work with these source file types.

If you are interested in us supporting more compiled file types then please pipe up by tweeting [@CodioHQ](http://twitter.com/CodioHQ).
