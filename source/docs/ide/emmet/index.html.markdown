We have implemented Emmet into the Codio IDE. These features let you saves loads of time when working with HTML and CSS.

Not only do you get a huge range of abbreviations that expand to code like this

	div>ul>li*3

results in 

	<div>
	    <ul>
	        <li></li>
	        <li></li>
	        <li></li>
	    </ul>
	</div>

... but you also get some very powerful keyboard shortcuts that can dramatically improve your productivity. Check these out in the sections in this chapter.

Be sure to check out the [complete reference](/docs/ide/emmet/emmet-ref/) as there are an awful lot of abbreviations for you to take advantage of.
