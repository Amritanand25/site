We've included the reference at the top rather than the bottom just to show you just how many HTML and CSS abbreviations there are. Rather than us replicating this list, we're going to send you over to the Emmet site where it is comprehensively laid out (in other words, we are too lazy to replicate it).

Just click on the image below to hop across.
