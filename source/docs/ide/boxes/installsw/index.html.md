> We are currently rolling out a new generation of Codio Boxes that will provide far greater power and control for you, as well as improved stability. These new Boxes provide full `sudo` (root) access, which means you no longer need to use the Box Parts package management system to install software. Instead, you can use the [apt](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/Howto) package manager, which provides thousands of software packages that are maintained by the Ubuntu community.
>
> Second generation projects and stacks are identified with a `G2` label, and we will be gradually updating all our Certified Stacks, Packs and Units to use the G2 platform.

This section contains details on how to install languages, databases, web servers and many other components. It also explains how to build your own installable components.
