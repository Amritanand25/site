> **DEPRECATION NOTICE**
>
> This section only concerns G1 (first generation) Boxes. For G2 Boxes, Box Parts is not available, and you should use the [apt](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/Howto) package manager.
>
> We are currently rolling out a new generation of Codio Boxes that will provide far greater power and control for you, as well as improved stability. These new Boxes provide full `sudo` (root) access, which means you no longer need to use the Box Parts package management system to install software. Instead, you can use the [apt](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/Howto) package manager, which provides thousands of software packages that are maintained by the Ubuntu community.
>
> Second generation projects and stacks are identified with a `G2` label, and we will be gradually updating all our Certified Stacks, Packs and Units to use the G2 platform.
