All Codio code workspace and software dependency files are located in the `/home/codio` folder, also reachable as `~`.

Everything below this level can be accessed and is effectively read-only. You should not change anything here as it will not persist.

## Code workspace files
The code workspace you see in the project file tree is located at `/home/codio/workspace` or `~/workspace`.

## Software dependencies
All new projects that you create will be G2 boxes. All languages, databases, web servers and other installable software components are typically located in the `/home/codio/etc ` folder.

For first generation projects, you can still use Box Parts and the installed software is located in the `/home/codio/.parts ` folder.
