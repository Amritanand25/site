When you create an empty Box, you get a standard Ubuntu installation. Currently, we also add the following software automatically

- Git

If you want to have more software installed by default then you should use Stacks or select one of the standard stacks from the New Project screen.

Please refer to the [Install software](/docs/ide/boxes/installsw/) section for details on how to install many other languages, database, web servers and other system components.
