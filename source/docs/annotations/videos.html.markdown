Adding videos, images and links to your annotations can make it easier to learn the subject matter.

You just add them into the annotations.md file using regular markdown as [described here](/docs/annotations/md-overview/). 

#Image
To insert an image, you need to specify the full path to the image, including the app name itself, for example

`![Bower Logo](app/img/bower-logo.png)`

Do not put a `/` at the start of the image path.

#Video
To insert a YouTube or Vimeo video into your annotations, just use the full URL of the video. Here is some example markdown

`![](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCWVeouuA1M)`
