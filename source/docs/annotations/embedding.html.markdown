title: Embedding a complete tutorial IDE in a page
class_name: docs

If you have a web page (a blog post, for example) with a good amount of available width, you can very easily embed the complete Codio IDE within it using an `<iframe>`.

Below is some sample HTML showing the Impress project in the fmay account being loaded with the impress.js file opened by default. Just load the IDE as you want it to display to an anonymous person and then copy and paste the URL into the src attribute.

    <iframe src="http://bit.ly/18t6hEW" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" marginheight="20" marginwidth="35" scrolling="auto"></iframe>

To ensure you get the display format you want, be sure to read the [Sharing and Embedding](/docs/sharing) section.
	
##Open in Tour Mode
You can open the IDE with your project running in Tour mode by specifying the url as described in the [Auto-starting from a URL](/docs/annotations/auto-start) page.
