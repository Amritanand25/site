A good way to explore annotations is to [create a new project](/docs/console/creating) and choose the Template option. Within the templates list you will find an Annotations project. 

You can also see some great examples of annotations on our [Tutorials page](https://codio.com/s/tutorials/tut-node/). These projects are all installable direct from GitHub, so you can see how they are built using annotations.
