Codio offers a standard way of [summarizing a project](/docs/ide/ide-general/readme-md) using a README.md file in the same way that Github does.

There are 2 ways to view the rendered output

- press Cmd+Alt+1 (Mac), Ctrl+Alt+1 (PC/Linux)

You may find this a good way of providing an introduction to your tutorial or annotated code samples. You can put your initial instructions in there as well as links to start the tour directly from the README without having to use a menu option. This is done by referencing the Tour URL as [explained here](/docs/annotations/auto-start).
