The best way to check out Annotations is to play with a real project. Click on the icon below to open up a project. Once it's opened up, be sure to check out the following things

- Click on any blue 'i' icons you see in the file tree and within code
- Open up the `annotations.md` file and take a look at how annotations are written
- look for the comments (which contain tokens like `@annotation:tour html-body`) in code files and you'll see the association with `annotations.md`
- Select `Tools > Annotations` from the menu and you'll be given a guided tour of the project
