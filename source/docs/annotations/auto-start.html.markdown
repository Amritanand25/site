Anyone accessing a Codio project that has annotations can launch a tour automatically via the URL.

When you open up a Codio project, you will see the url of your project, something like this

	http://codio.com/account_name/project_name

Simple append `/tour`

	http://codio.com/account_name/project_name/tour
