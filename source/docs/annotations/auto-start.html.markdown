Anyone accessing a Codio project that has annotations can press the Tour or Explore buttons******** to initiate the tour. However, you can also launch a tour automatically via the URL.

This example shows how you can launch a tour using a URL

	http://codio.com/fmay/impress/tour

and this one launches explore mode

	http://codio.com/fmay/impress/explore
