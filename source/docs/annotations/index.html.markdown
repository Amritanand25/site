Codio Annotations is a set of features that lets you create rich, interactive code samples and documentation for any  project in any programming language. 

Codio Annotations does a wonderful job for the following

- Building rich, interactive coding tutorials in any language for any skill level
- Documenting APIs, libraries or frameworks where well documented code examples flatten the learning curve for developers

You set it up by inserting special tokens into comment lines in your source code files. You can use the Codio IDE or any other IDE to do this. These tokens are then associated with a special file called `annotations.codio` which contains the rich content.

Any project with these tokens can be run in the Codio IDE and a user then can do the following

- Get a guided tour of the code
- Explore the code structure by clicking on annotation icons within the file tree
- Click on annotation icons within source files to bring up rich text within a popup window

If you choose to use the Codio IDE then you are also provided with helper shortcuts that insert tokens for you and corresponding tokens in the annotations file.
