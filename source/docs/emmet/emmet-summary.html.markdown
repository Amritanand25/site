##Abbreviations
Thanks to our Emmet support, you get a large number of [HTML and CSS abbreviations](/docs/emmet/emmet-abbreviations/) that expand to code, a bit like this

	div>ul>li*3

which expands to 

	<div>
	    <ul>
	        <li></li>
	        <li></li>
	        <li></li>
	    </ul>
	</div>

Be sure to check out the [complete reference](/docs/emmet/emmet-ref/) as there are an awful lot of abbreviations for you to take advantage of.
