Most developers are familiar with these great tools. They let you distill a coding problem down into a working code example that consists of a small set of individual files and run them. The purpose is to focus in on a specific way of solving a problem.

Codio allows you to do exactly the same but it also allows you to move beyond a fixed set of files and use an IDE approach to explain more complex solutions to more complex problems.

##What you need to know
If you don't want to learn much about the Codio IDE and just want to show some code, then all you need to know is the following

- Create an Account - (Codio is free for all public projects)
- [Importing a Project](/docs/console/creating/) (usually by importing from ZIP or cloning a Git repo)
- [Sharing and Embedding your project](/docs/ide/sharing)

##Scenario 1 : Codepen
It's actually very easy to achieve a Codepen type layout.

1. Open your project in the IDE
1. From the menu, go to `View > Layout > Showcase`
1. Configure your panels
1. Open up your files in the panels (click on the panel first before selecting a file)
1. Select the bottom panel that crosses the entire width and then select `Tools > Preview` to open up an inline preview in the panel.
1. Close down the file tree if you don't need to let the user navigate files
1. From the menu, go to `Project > Share` (read about Sharing [here](/docs/ide/sharing))

##Scenario 2 : IDE Tutorial / Project
This scenario is set up in the same way as the above scenario. However, rather than selecting `View > Layout > Showcase`, you set up the panels in any way you want them as described in the [Panels]() section.

The file tree lets the user navigate around the code and you can have a preview running in any panel you choose.

Here are a couple of more advanced layouts that show a file tree with custom layouts.
