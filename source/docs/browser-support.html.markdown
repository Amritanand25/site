Codio should run fine on the following browsers

- **Chrome** - anything later than 25 should run fine and earlier versions may run, too; if you're Chrome is reasonably up to date then Codio should work perfectly
- **Firefox** - Version22 or later
- **IE** - IE10 or later
- **Safari** - version 6 or later
- **Opera** - ???

If you are experiencing any issue where Codio will not run and the abive list says it should, then either Tweet @CodioHQ or send an email to support@codio.com.
