Once you have found the Starter Pack you want to use, you can click on the Use Pack icon or button. This will then transfer you directly to the Create Project dialog, so Codio can create a new Project for you based on the selected Starter Pack.

You can now give your new Project a name and change any other settings as required. When you press 'Create', your Starter Pack will be loaded in to a new Project and you will be taken to the IDE.
