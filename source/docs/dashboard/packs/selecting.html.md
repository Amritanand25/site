Once you have found the Starter Pack you want to use, you can create a new Project based on this in either of these ways

1. Click on the Use Pack icon on the right side of the listing. 
2. Click within the listing to see full details about this Pack before pressing the `User Start Pack` button in the top right of the information panel.

You will then be transferred to the [Create Project]() dialog, so Codio can create a new Project for you based on the selected Starter Pack.
