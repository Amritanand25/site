You can create a new Starter Pack by pressing the 'Create Pack' button in the top right of the screen. You will then be asked to provide some details.

##Selecting the Source
You need to tell Codio where to get its source code from. There are two options

- **Codio** : you have a Codio project where your code is located
- **Git/Mercural** : you can specify a Git or Mercurial repo that gets pulled in afresh each time someone creates a new Project based on your Starter Pack

##Selecting a Stack
Each Starter Pack requires a [Stack](). If you only need a base Ubuntu Box, then you do not need to specify a Stack.

##Description Details
You can add short and long descriptions as well as an image and tags. Tags are important and will allow you and others to find Packs in a more targeted fashion.

##Visibilty
You can make your Packs Private (with a paid subscription) or Public.

##Ownership
You can specify whether other Codio Users within your Organizatio are able to access and Administer your Packs. If you are not a member of an Organiation, this cannot be used.
