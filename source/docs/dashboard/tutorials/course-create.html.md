Before you create a Tutorial, you should have prepared at least one Codio Project that is ready to add as a module. Please make sure you have read the [Guides](/docs/ide/tools/guides/) documentation as a module requires a Guide.

To create a new Tutorial, press the 'Create Tutorial' button in the top right of then screen on the main Tutorials screen.

##Name, Descriptions, Image & Tags
You are required to enter a name for your course. The Short Description is optional but please add something so others can easily identify it.

A Long Description is usually a good idea and helps other users understand the scope of your Tutorial.

You should also add tags that identify the technologies used. An image is also suggested.

##Visibility
This determines whether your Tutorial is publicly available to all Codio users or should remain private to you and/or your [Organization](/docs/dashboard/organizations/) (if you are a member of an Organization). Private Tutorials require a paid subscription.

##Owner
By default, you are the owner of the Tutorial you create. If you select an Organization from the dropdown, then any Owner team members of that Organization are able to adminster the Tutorial and all Organization members will be able to see it in the listing, even if the Tutorial is marked as private. 

##Collaborators
If you want to assign administration rights to an individual users, then add them to this section.
