Only Tutorial owners or those with administration permissions may modify modules.

Let's say you have created a module and then you decide you want to update the Codio project associated with that module. 

You can edit the source Codio project by opening it from your normal Codio projects list. 

Alternatively, if you are viewing the Tutorial in the Tutorials list, you can open it by clicking on Tutorial and then press the `Edit` button.

You then select the module you want to update and then click the `Refresh Source` button for the relevant module as shown below.

You should be aware that if you have created a [class](/docs/dashboard/classroom) and assigned that module to that class then any modifications will not be seen by the class.
