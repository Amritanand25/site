Each class has at least one teacher. The teacher that created the class will have been added as a teacher automatically.

Tecahers can

- modify class properties
- delete the class
- access student code from the class listing
- assign grades and comments to each student module assignment

To add further teachers to the class, select the Teachers link as shown above.

You can now add Teachers by searching for Codio users using their full name or their Codio user name.

Teachers, as opposed to class collaborators, are only able to 

- assign modules to classes
- view student code from the class modules list
- grade and comment
