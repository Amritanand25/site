It can happen that after you create your module you make some changes to the original module by modifying the source Codio projects. If this happens, you will not see these changes reflected in the class modules.

The complete steps to update your module module with a modified Codio project are [described here](/docs/dashboard/modules/module-modify).

This updates the module units but it does not update the class module, as these are copies. To update the class from the module, enable the 'Edit Units' toggle button and press the 'Refresh Source' button (circled below) for the required module(s)

##Active Classes with Students already completing Units
If you refresh the source, any students who have already started working on those units will not see the changes. They will need to fork the project again to see the changes
