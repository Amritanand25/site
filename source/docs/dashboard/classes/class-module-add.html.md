## Searching for Modules
The Module browser will open for you to search for the module(s) you wish to add.

Coming Soon: You will also be able to search for Courses to add the Modules contained in the Course

You can filter from the available options in the tabs, or search by simply typing into the search field, whereupon Codio will search within all Module names, descriptions and owner fields and filter your list accordingly.

You can also order the list of modules by name or owner
