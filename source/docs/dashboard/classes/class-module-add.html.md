## Searching for Modules
The Module browser will open for you to search for the module(s) you wish to add.

You can also search for Courses to add the Modules contained in those Courses

You can filter from the available options in the tabs, or search by simply typing into the search field, whereupon Codio will search within all Module names, descriptions and owner fields and filter your list accordingly.
