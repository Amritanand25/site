Codio's grading features address four important aspects of student grading.

- **Assign grade** - manually reviewing student code projects and then assigning a grade.
- **Grading moderation** - having other lecturers review grades already assigned in order to monitor consistency of grading.
- **Grading rubric** - coming in early June 2016, this provides a grading guideline framework for teachers. Anyone assigning a grade will be shown the grading rubric, a two dimensional matrix with integrated grade calculation. For novice teachers this is a helpful way of ensuring accurate grading. This also helps ensure a consistency of grading in larger departments several different people are assessing coding assignment within a class of students.
- **LMS gradebook sycnhronization** - coming in late May 2016, this feature ensures that when teachers release grades, the data is passed automatically to any LTI enabled LMS platform such as Moodle, Blackboard and Canvas.

### The grading process
Once students have completed their assignments, they should notify the teacher of completion by going to the 'Education->Mark as completed' menu item within the IDE. The techer is then able to see whose project is ready to be graded.

To see the above screen, the teacher selects the assignment unit. You can see the check mark next to those students who have completed the assignment.


At this point, the teacher will probably [review the code](/docs/dashboard/classes/view-student-code) and then assign comments and ultimately a grade.

To assign comments or a grade, you click on the pencil icon (see below). You can then modify the comments and grade fields for any individual student.

The student will be able to see this when they view this information in the classes/module screen.
