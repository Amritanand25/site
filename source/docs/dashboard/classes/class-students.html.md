Once you have selected a class, click on the Student menu item as shown below.

![Classes Add Students](/img/docs/class_addstudents.png)

From here you can add students to the class by enabling the 'Edit Students' toggle button and then add in new students.

Use the drop down to show you the list of all Students currently available in your Organisation and select them.

You can also start typing in the field to enter the Codio user name or a part of their full name and as you type the list will automatically filter for you.

You can remove students by pressing the `Delete` button next to a student name.
