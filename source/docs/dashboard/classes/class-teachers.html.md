Each class needs at least one teacher and can be added as required.

Teachers can

- modify class properties
- delete the class
- access student code from the class listing
- assign grades and comments to each student module assignment (coming soon)

![Classes Add Teachers](/img/docs/class_addteachers.png)

To add teachers to the class, enable the 'Edit Teachers' toggle button and then add in new teachers.

Use the drop down to show you the list of all Teachers currently available in your Organisation and select them.

You can also start typing in the field to enter the Codio user name or a part of their full name and as you type the list will automatically filter for you.

You can remove teachers by pressing the `Delete` button next to a teacher name.
