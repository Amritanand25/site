Once you have assigned your Course to the class and added students, you are ready to hand out your first assignment.

Modules can be assigned to classes by 

- the class owner
- collaborators (defined in Edit screen of the class)
- teachers

Select your class from the main classes listing. You should see the Course name and all modules belonging to that Course.

Now, for the module you want to assign to the class, click on the right most icon. Below, you can see that the first module has already been assigned but the others have not. The assign buttons are circled.

This will take you to the module->class assignment screen. You will see all class students listed here. All class students will be listed and pre-selected. If you decide you do not want to assign this module to any individual students then you can deselect the student now.

Once you are ready, you click the 'Assign' button. 

At this point, an email will be sent to the Student with a link to the assignment, which, when clicked on, will open up the Codio IDE with that project loaded. From that point onwards, the student will also see the project in their normal projects listing.

Another way for the student to access their code is to go the the Classes menu item in the dashboard. They can select the appropriate class and then they will see all the modules for that class. They can then open up the project in the IDE by pressing the right most icon.
