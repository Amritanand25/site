Once your class is set up, your students can start working.

The student can access the modules by going to the the Classes menu item in the dashboard. They can select the appropriate class and then they will see all the modules for that class. 

They can then open up the module to see the units and from there can then open project in the IDE by pressing the 'Start Unit' button.

This will fork the project into the students Codio account and will also be accessible to them from their My Units list in future. The students will then see 'Open Unit' in the above image.

Teachers are able to see the students who have assigned themselves units in the modules by selecting the Module.

If the counter is zero, none of the students have yet assigned themselves the units, but otherwise, select the Unit and a list of all the students who have assigned themselves that unit will be shown.

Teachers can enable/disable units here:

1. Any units that are disabled will not be accessible by your students, either to Start a new unit or if they have already started the unit in the past, from their My Units area. 
1. Teachers are still able to view the Students Unit if required. This can be useful if running a Controlled Assessment in  classes or if authoring your own content and wish to check it out within the class yourself first. 

Teachers can also open the unit as a 'Teacher' to access the [Teacher Solutions](/docs/teacher/special/tsolutions/).

The Students tab will show all the students that have assigned themselves units in the modules.
