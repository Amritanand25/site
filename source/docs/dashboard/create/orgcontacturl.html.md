If you wish to set a contact URL for your students (e.g. you have a forum or LMS discussion area for them to use), you can do so in the following way:

1. Click your name/gravatar, bottom of the left hand pane
<img alt="profile" src="/img/docs/class_administration/profilepic.png" class="simple"/>

1. Click on the name of your  educational organization - under **My Organizations**, which is about halfway down the screen. 
<img alt="organisation" src="/img/docs/class_administration/addteachers/myschoolorg.png" class="simple"/>

1. Click the **Organization settings** tab 
<img alt="organisation settings" src="/img/docs/manage_organization/orgsettingstab.png" class="simple"/>

1. Go to the **Contact URL** section toward the  bottom of the page, and enter the URL you wish to use. 
<img alt="organisation contact url" src="/img/docs/manage_organization/orgcontacturl.png" class="simple"/>

1. If this is set, when a student uses any of the ways to contact us, they will be given the option to report a problem, ask a question related to their course work or if they have a problem accessing the Codio platform, or loading a unit can contact us

1. A contact URL can also be set at the [class](/docs/classes/classmanagement/classcontacturl) level so if you have specific areas/forums for your classes for students to raise questions, you can set the contact URL there and it will override the organisation setting

**N.B. "Teacher" accounts will not be effected by this setting and they will still be able to contact Codio in the usual manner. See [Support](/docs/dashboard/support/) for more on this**
