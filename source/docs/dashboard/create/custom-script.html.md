To integrate third-party systems to help/track students, custom scripts can be enabled.

Enabling this will allow third-party systems (such as [sense.network](/docs/content/authoring/assessments/assessments-sense-network) to help/track students.

In all cases, the `userid`,`email` and the user type (Student/Teacher) will be passed.

If required by the third-party system used, custom js code can be included in the **Custom Script** section. 

Any such code should be entered without script tags.
