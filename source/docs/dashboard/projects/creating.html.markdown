Create a new project, or import one by, clicking on the Create Project button on the Dashboard as shown below.

![Create Project](/img/docs/project_create.png)

You can then choose which of the following Project creation methods you want to use

Select a commonly used Stack:

- **Default:** an empty Ubuntu Box with no code workspace (suitable for HTML/CSS/JS projects)
- **LAMP:** LAMP Stack containing PHP, Apache and MySql with no code workspace
- **Python3:** Python3 Stack with no code workspace

or 

To select an alternative software configuration where you can select from other [Stacks](/docs/dashboard/stacks/), [Starter Packs](/docs/dashboard/stacks/)  or import code in from Git, Mercurial, FTP, SFTP or from a Zip file, click on the 'Click here....' to then see:

**Note: Node/Ruby & Git are preinstalled in all projects**

##Selecting a Stack
If you are selecting the alternative option, you can then specify a default Stack for your new Project. If you don't select one, you'll get an empty Ubuntu Box using the Default Stack

##Details
You need to give your project a name and a description.


##Visibility
By default, your Project will be public, meaning it is findable by any Codio user. If you have a subscription, you can mark the Project as private. You can assign access read, write and full admin rights (ability for others to access the Box from the terminal) to other users for the Project from within the IDE from the `Project->Permissions` menu.
