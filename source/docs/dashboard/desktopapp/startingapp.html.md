When first starting the app you need to choose the server to connect to. In most cases this will be **https://codio.com** but if you are in the United Kingdom/Europe, it maybe **https://codio.co.uk**.

You can check by logging into your Codio account and you will see the server domain noted there

Having selected the server log in using your codio credentials.

<i>**Note:** that if you usually access Codio through an [LMS](/docs/classes/lti/), you may not have a Codio account password set. If that is the case, go to the online login screen where you can go through the [lost password](/docs/dashboard/account/forgotpassword/) process to define a codio account password. We would then recommend you log into your account online and change this password to one you will remember in the future.  Setting a Codio account password will not effect or change how you access Codio via your LMS</i>
