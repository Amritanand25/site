In order to get the most out of Codio, we recommend you create an Organization. You can request a trial  from the [Subscriptions]() page. 

Currently, the main advantage of an Organization account is 

- Access to [Classrooms]()
- Teachers and Students can create private Projects, Stacks, Starter Packs and Tutorials

We will be adding a great deal of functionality here to support easy signup, student driven assignment to classes, collaboration and other advanced features.

##Subscriptions and Trials
We offer very substantial Organization discounts to schools and universities. We also offer Codio for free in certain special situations.

To apply for a trial, head to the [Subscriptions]() section and click on the Trial or Education Discount links.
