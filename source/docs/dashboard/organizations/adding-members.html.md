1. Select your Organization from the list (there is probably only one there).
1. `All Teams` should already be selected above the list.
1. Click on the `All members` or `Owners` button, depending on the status of the user you are adding.
1. Add the Codio user (you can search by Codio user name or full name, if they entered one).
