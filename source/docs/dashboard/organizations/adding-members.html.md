To manually add Codio users to your organization

1. Open the Organizations up (click on the icon bottom left).
1. Select your Organization from the list (there is probably only one there).
1. `Teams` should already be selected above the list.
1. Click on the appropriate Permanent Teams available for the user you are adding.
1. Add the Codio user (you can search by Codio user name or full name, if they entered one).


Alternatively, go to `Organisation Settings` area and create an invitation token.

Send the generated link out to all users who you wish to include in your organisation and they will be automatically added. If they do not already have a Codio account, they will be taken through the sign up process and then added to your organisation.
