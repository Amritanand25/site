Only Course owners or those with administration permissions for the course can add modules. Please refer to the [Create a new Course](/docs/dashboard/courses/course-create/) section for information on permissions and collaborators.

A Module is a group of Codio projects, each of which contains

- a code workspace and files
- a [Codio Guide](/docs/dashboard/modules/guides)

Having created the course, select it and then the 'Modules' tab. Enable the 'Edit Modules' toggle button and then press the `Add Module` button to add a new module.

## Searching for Modules
The Module browser will open for you to search for the module(s) you wish to add. 

You can filter from the available options in the tabs, or search by simply typing into the search field, whereupon Codio will search within all Module names, descriptions and owner fields and filter your list accordingly.

You can also order the list of modules by name or owner and use the 'Filter by Course' drop down to view modules in other courses.
