Only Course owners or those with administration permissions for the course can add modules. Please refer to the [Create a new Course](/docs/dashboard/courses/course-create/) section for information on permissions and collaborators.

A Course module is simply a Codio project that contains

- a code workspace and files
- a [Codio Guide](/docs/dashboard/courses/guides)

Press the `Add Module` button to add a new module.

##Add Details
Add a description and, importantly, a good description of the project that is helpful to others browsing Course and module content.

##Select the Source
You should select the Codio Project that the module is taken from. 

Once you have chosen a source for your module, a snapshot is made and is stored in a separate storage location. Any modifications you make to your source Project will not be reflected in the module unless you refresh it. 

##Refreshing the module from the source Project
If you do make changes to your source Project and you want these to be reflected in the Course module, you will need to select the module and then press the `Refresh Source` button.
