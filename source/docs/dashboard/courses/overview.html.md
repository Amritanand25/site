The `Courses` menu item can be found in the left menu area of the Codio dashboard beneath the 'Classes' menu item.

Courses are a way to group and order [Modules](/docs/dashboard/modules/) into a coherent course and (coming soon), be able to access your Courses when creating [Classes](/docs/dashboard/classes/).
