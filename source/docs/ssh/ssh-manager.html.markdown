You can manage your SSH connections by going to the Tools->SSH->Connection Manager menu item.

If you have created any connections you will see them listed. You can add connections and edit them.

##Creating and Editing Connections
Press the Create New button to create a new connection or the pencil icon to edit an existing connection.

You enter the remote server credentials : user name, hostname and optionally port. You can also specify a friendly name that will appear in the connections list.

##Public Keys
If you want to add your Codio public key to the remote server, press the key icon in the Connection Manager listing. This will prevent you from needing to enter a password.

If you want to add your public key manually, please refer to the [Codio public key](/docs/settings-prefs/account-settings/public-key) documentation.

##Making a connection
To make a connection, you click on the leftmost icon, which opens the connection in a new tab.
