Codio provides the ability to connect to a remote server via SSH. You can open multiple connections and manage connections through the [SSH Connection Manager](/docs/ssh/ssh-manager).

The [Quick Connect](/docs/ssh/quick-connect) option lets you access remote servers on an ad hoc basis. The SSH Connection Manager lets you store connections for quick access later.

You should be able to do the same things you can do in a regular terminal window, including running text editors etc.
