**Important** : if you are looking for information on how to connect to your project 'Box' using the terminal/console window, then please [read about Boxes](/docs/boxes).

Codio provides the ability to connect to remote servers via SSH. You can open multiple connections and manage connections through the [SSH Connection Manager](/docs/ssh/ssh-manager).

A [Quick Connect](/docs/ssh/quick-connect) option lets you access remote servers on an ad hoc basis. The SSH Connection Manager lets you store connections for quick access later.

You can do the same things you can do in a regular terminal window, including running text editors like Nano etc.

##Copy & Paste
If you want to copy from or paste into the SSH window, you will need to press Ctrl+A followed by Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V (Cmd for Mac users).

You can also use the right-click menu.
