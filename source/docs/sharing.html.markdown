##Suggested Buttons
You will notice that there are two suggested buttons available.

- **Demo** : the suggested button for any situation where you want to link to a demo project. A great example would be on your Github page, where you want to be able to show a demo of your code as well as allowing the user to browse around the code itself.
- **Show me the code** : the suggested button for any situation where you want to link a blog, tutorial or some documentation to a real code sample.

##Markdown or HTML
You can choose between Markdown or HTML by clicking on the labels. Markdown is great for your Github README.md pages.

Once you have made your selection you can copy and paste as required.
