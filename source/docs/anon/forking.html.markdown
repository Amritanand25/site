Look for the Fork button in the top bar as shown below ...

![Fork project](/img/docs/fork-ide.png)

Any anonymous project can be forked. If you are not signed into an account then this will create a new anonymous project URL and a cookie will be planted on your PC so that you can edit it in the future. However, you will only be able to edit it from the same PC and browser that was used to create it.

[Creating an account](/docs/signup/) is strongly recommended if you intend to do anything more than play with a single project as it will organize your projects nicely, as well as giving other goodies. Having an account with public projects is and always will be free.

If you are signed into a Codio account, then forking another project will create the fork in your own account.
