If you plan to do any serious development in Codio then it is strongly recommended that you [create an account](/docs/signup/). It costs nothing and the benefits to you just in terms of being able to organize your projects are considerable.

If you want to edit a project anonymously please be aware of the following:

- You will need the URL of the project
- Codio will look for a cookie on your PC to confirm that you are the person that created this project in the first place. If it cannot find it, you cannot edit it (although you can [fork](/docs/anon/forking) it and carry on from there).
- You will be able to [fork](/docs/anon/forking) an anonymous project into an account once you have created one and are signed in.
