##Accessing your Box from outside
If you want to access your Box from an external location, then you will need to use the following url

    projectname.username.codiodev.com:port
    
*TODO: update domain name once on production servers*
    
##Ports
You can configure external access to your project over ports 1024 - 4000, so you'll need to configure your Web Server, Node.JS etc., to use a port within this range.
