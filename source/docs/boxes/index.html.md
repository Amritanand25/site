As soon as you create a new project, it automatically gets a back-end box provisioned that is dedicated to that project.

This chapter covers the features provided by Boxes

- [How to access the Box console or terminal](/docs/boxes/terminal)
- [Public access to your boxes](/docs/boxes/ext-access)
- [Sleepy Boxes](/docs/boxes/sleep)
- [Configuring single terminal/console commands from the 'Run' menu](/docs/boxes/run)
- [SSH keys for accessing remote systems](/docs/boxes/ssh)
- [Locating your code in the `~/workspace` folder](/docs/boxes/workspace)
- [Restarting and resetting Boxes](/docs/boxes/restart-reset)
- [How to install Box components (everything from languages to middleware to databases)](/docs/boxes/box-parts)
- [Requesting new Box back-end environments such as PHP, Python](/docs/boxes/request-language)
- [Debugging Node applications](/docs/boxes/node-debugger)

Users do not get `sudo` access but in most cases this should not be necessary. You can run most commands within your Box without `sudo`. If you find that there are things you require access for, please email support@codio.com and we can extend available commands in many cases.
