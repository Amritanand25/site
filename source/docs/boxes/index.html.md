As soon as you create a new project, it automatically gets a back-end box provisioned that is dedicated to that project.

**IMPORTANT** : Codio Boxes are shut down when you exit your project. The good news is that they start so fast you won't even notice. Better news, we will be introducing Always On Boxes soon. Please [read about sleepy Boxes](/docs/boxes/sleep) first.

This chapter covers the features provided by Boxes

Users do not get `sudo` access but you shouldn't miss it. In fact, you'll probably be glad you don't have to type it.

If you find there are languages or components that are not present, we can add them as [Box Parts](/docs/boxes/box-parts) really quickly. Take a look at [Requesting New Box Parts](/docs/boxes/request-language) to find out how to request a new Box Part.
