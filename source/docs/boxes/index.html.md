As soon as you create a new project, it automatically gets a back-end box provisioned that is dedicated to that project.

This chapter covers the features provided by Boxes

- [how to access the Box console or terminal](/docs/boxes/terminal)
- [configuring single terminal/console commands from the 'Run' menu](/docs/boxes/run)
- [SSH keys for accessing remote systems](/docs/boxes/ssh)
- [requesting new Box back-end environments such as PHP, Python](/docs/boxes/request-language)
- [debugging Node applications](/docs/boxes/node-debugger)

Users not get `sudo` access but in most cases this should not be necessary. You can run most commands within your Box without `sudo`. If you find that there are things you require access for, please email support@codio.com and we will can extend available commands in many cases.
