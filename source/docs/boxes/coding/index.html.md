Although Codio doesn't give you root access, you can in fact install pretty much anything you like onto a Codio Box if you are happy downloading and compiling your own binary components. Non binary components can be simply downloaded.

However, the beauty about Box Parts is that you can encapsulate the installation steps of any component into a Codio Box Part. 

Box Parts are Open Source and so all Box Parts are available to all Codio users, giving a rapidly growing ecosystem of instantly installable stack components. Details of our Box Parts GitHub repo are in the next section.

##Ruby
Box Parts use Ruby as the scripting language. Luckily, you need only very basic Ruby knowledge for most scripts. Our [Example Package (MySQL Part)](/docs/boxes/coding/example) gives you an idea of a typical Box Part.

Most Box Parts packages will look very similar.
