Codio manages SSH keys at the user level. To see your public key, please [read this section](/docs/settings-prefs/account-settings/public-key). 

When you create a new Codio project, your keys are automatically copied into your project and can be found in the `~/.ssh` folder. You will need to open up a Terminal window to access this folder and the `id_rsa` keys.

This centrally managed key approach means that you can use a single SSH key on multiple remotes.
