Codio manages SSH keys for you You Codio account will generate a key-pair and can be found in the IDE as [described here](/docs/settings-prefs/account-settings/public-key). 

When you create a new Codio project, your user keys are automatically copied into your project and can be found in the `~/.ssh` folder. You will need to open up a Terminal window to access this folder and the `id_rsa` keys.
