Your Box will be active while you are using the IDE. However, we will put it to sleep in the following situations

- 2 minutes after you exit your project in the IDE
- 30 minutes after there is no IDE activity

The good news is that the startup time for your Box is extremely fast, so you will not even notice your Box starting up!

If you want to have an [Always On Box](/docs/boxes/always-on), we will be introducing these from March 2014 with a paid subscription.
