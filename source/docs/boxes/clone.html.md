Subscribers can allow their box to be clonable. 

**reasons and use?**

##How to enable your box for cloning

To allow your box to be clonable, go to Project>Settings and check the `Allow Box Cloning` checkbox

![Clone Settings][/img/docs/clone-settings.png]

Be aware that allowing your Box to be cloned may mean that sensitive data is made available to others. This is because all data within your Box will be cloned if you enable this option.

If you have data that you do not wish to be cloned, create a `.forkignore` file in your project workspace, with the paths of files and directories that you wish to exclude from cloning.
