You can access the Terminal window from the 'Tools->Terminal' menu item. This will open up a terminal window in a new IDE tab. You can also have multiple consoles open simultaneously.

Your project is mapped to the `~/workspace` folder.

Note that you can create tabs and panels anywhere you like using Codio's [Panels and Tabs](/docs/panels/) features.
