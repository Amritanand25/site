You can access the Terminal window from the 'Tools->Terminal' menu item. This will open up a terminal window in a new IDE tab. You can also have multiple consoles open simultaneously.

Your project is mapped to the `~/workspace` folder.

Note that you can create tabs and panels anywhere you like using Codio's [Panels and Tabs](/docs/ide/panels/) features.

##Copy & Paste operations
Behavior varies between Macs and other operating systems. Using the right-click menu should work on all systems.

###Mac
Copy and paste both works as expected with cmd+c and cmd+v. 

###Windows, Linux
Pasting is done as expected with ctrl+v but pasting cannot be done as this is conflicts with the 'kill process' shortcut. You will need to copy using the right-click menu.
