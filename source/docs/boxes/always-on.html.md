Always-On Boxes is now available in Beta for all paid subscribers. 

For the duration of the Beta, you can enable a single Box to be Always-On. This means that it will remain active whether you are in the IDE or even logged out.

When we come out of beta, we will provide means of enabling more than one Box to be Always-On.

You can set a Box to Always-On from the 'Project->Settings' menu if you're in the IDE. If you're in the Dashboard, then press the gear icon on a project item to change its settings.
