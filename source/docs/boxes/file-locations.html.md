All Codio code workspace and software dependency files are located in the `/home/codio` folder, also reachable as `~`.

Everything below this level can be accessed and is effectively read-only. You should not change anything here as it will not persist.

##Code workspace files
The code workspace you see in the project file tree is located at `/home/codio/workspace` or `~/workspace`.

##Software dependencies
All languages, databases, web servers and other [installable software components]() are located in the `/home/codio/.parts ` folder.
